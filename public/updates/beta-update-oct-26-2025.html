        <h1>📅 Training Programs Are Here</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Your coach can now build complete multi-week training plans – when you need them.</p>

        <p>Some of you follow a box program. Some work with a personal trainer and just want to log workouts for accountability. Some are training for a Spartan race or 5K. Some train intuitively. Some just want a coach to talk to about today's workout. That's all perfect – NeonPanda works however you train.</p>

        <p>But for those times when you need a structured plan – getting ready for the 2026 CrossFit Open, prepping for a powerlifting meet, building a strength cycle, training for an endurance event – your coaches can now build complete programs through conversation. No other AI coaching platform can do this.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <h3>🎯 When You Need Structure, It's There</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Training Programs are <strong>intelligent systems</strong> for when you want:</p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
                <li>Multi-week progression toward a specific goal (competition prep, strength cycles, etc.)</li>
                <li>Phase-based periodization with strategic progression and deloads</li>
                <li>A coach who knows where you're headed long-term, not just what you're doing today</li>
                <li>Calendar-based accountability that adapts when life gets chaotic</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0;"><em>But if you don't need this? Keep logging workouts and chatting with your coach like always. Both approaches work beautifully.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <span class="section-badge">NEW FEATURE</span>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 10px; color: #00ffff;">💬 Build Mode - Talk Your Way to a Program</h2>
            <p>Forget forms. Forget templates. Just <strong>talk to your coach about what you want to achieve</strong>, and they'll build a complete training program through conversation.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Here's how it works:</p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                <li><strong>Switch to Build Mode</strong> in any conversation with the new purple toggle</li>
                <li><strong>Tell your coach your goal:</strong> "I want to build strength for the next 8 weeks" or "Need a program to prep for my first powerlifting meet"</li>
                <li><strong>Answer their questions naturally:</strong> They'll ask about your schedule, equipment, experience, constraints – just like a real coach would</li>
                <li><strong>Get a complete program:</strong> Your coach generates a structured plan with phases, progression, and daily workout templates written in plain English</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><em>No forms. No dropdowns. Just conversation. That's the NeonPanda way.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <span class="section-badge">PHASE 1: FOUNDATION</span>
            <h2 style="margin-top: 10px; color: #BF00FF;">⚡ What Shipped This Week</h2>
            <p>This release is <strong>Phase 1</strong> – the infrastructure and ability to create training programs through conversation. You can build complete programs with your coach right now. Phase 2 (viewing your program calendar, tracking adherence, logging from templates) ships next.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Behind the scenes, we built:</p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                <li><strong>Smart calendar generation:</strong> Your program knows "today's workout" based on YOUR timezone, not server time. Handles rest days, pauses, and real-world schedule chaos.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase-aware AI:</strong> Your coach understands where you are in the program and what comes next. They can intelligently adapt workouts based on your current phase goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic search integration:</strong> Training programs get stored in Pinecone so your coach can reference past programs, learn from what worked, and avoid what didn't.</li>
                <li><strong>Async generation:</strong> Program building happens in the background while your coach keeps you updated with real-time progress messages. No waiting around.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><em>You just see a smooth conversation. We see hundreds of hours of engineering that made it feel effortless.</em></p>
        </div>

        <h2>🔧 UI Polish & Navigation Upgrades</h2>
        <p>Because good infrastructure deserves a good interface:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Redesigned sidebar navigation</strong> with hover-based flyout menu for utility items – way cleaner on desktop</li>
            <li><strong>Mode toggle component</strong> that's perfectly aligned, properly styled, and feels buttery smooth to click</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent icon sizing</strong> across all navigation items in collapsed sidebar view</li>
            <li><strong>Centralized UI patterns</strong> for dividers, spacing, and containers – making future features ship faster</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p>We're shipping fast. Here's what's coming:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="emoji">📊</span> <strong>Training Programs Phase 2:</strong> Program dashboard showing your current phase, today's prescribed workout, adherence tracking, and calendar view with one-tap logging from templates</li>
            <li><span class="emoji">🔄</span> <strong>Adaptation Intelligence:</strong> Your coach automatically adjusts programs when life happens and you miss workouts – keeping you on track toward your goal</li>
            <li><span class="emoji">⚡</span> <strong>Faster Workout Logging:</strong> Voice logging, quick-capture templates, and smarter AI parsing to make logging workouts feel instant instead of tedious</li>
            <li><span class="emoji">🧠</span> <strong>Coach Evolution System:</strong> Your coaches learn new specialties (CrossFit, Endurance, Olympic Lifting) based on your training. The more you work together, the more specialized they become in what you actually do</li>
            <li><span class="emoji">📈</span> <strong>Exercise Progression Tracking:</strong> See your strength gains over time – how your 5RM squat has improved, your running pace trends, skill progressions. Works whether you're on a program or logging individually</li>
            <li><span class="emoji">🎙️</span> <strong>Voice Conversations:</strong> Talk to your coach hands-free while you're warming up – for programs, workouts, or just chatting about training</li>
        </ul>
