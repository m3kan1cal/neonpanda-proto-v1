        <p class="subtitle">
          Your coach can now build complete multi-week training plans – when you
          need them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of you follow a box program. Some work with a personal trainer
          and just want to log workouts for accountability. Some are training
          for a Spartan race or 5K. Some train intuitively. Some just want a
          coach to talk to about today's workout. That's all perfect – NeonPanda
          works however you train.
        </p>

        <p>
          But for those times when you need a structured plan – getting ready
          for the 2026 CrossFit Open, prepping for a powerlifting meet, building
          a strength cycle, training for an endurance event – your coaches can
          now build complete programs through conversation. No other AI coaching
          platform can do this.
        </p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h3>🎯 When You Need Structure, It's There</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 10px">
            Training Programs are <strong>intelligent systems</strong> for when
            you want:
          </p>
          <ul style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
            <li>
              Multi-week progression toward a specific goal (competition prep,
              strength cycles, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Phase-based periodization with strategic progression and deloads
            </li>
            <li>
              A coach who knows where you're headed long-term, not just what
              you're doing today
            </li>
            <li>
              Calendar-based accountability that adapts when life gets chaotic

            💬 Build Mode - Talk Your Way to a Program
          </h2>
          <p>
            Forget forms. Forget templates. Just
            <strong>talk to your coach about what you want to achieve</strong>,
            and they'll build a complete training program through conversation.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px">Here's how it works:</p>
          <ul style="margin-top: 10px">
            <li>
              <strong>Switch to Build Mode</strong> in any conversation with the
              new purple toggle
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tell your coach your goal:</strong> "I want to build
              strength for the next 8 weeks" or "Need a program to prep for my
              first powerlifting meet"
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Answer their questions naturally:</strong> They'll ask
              about your schedule, equipment, experience, constraints – just
              like a real coach would
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Get a complete program:</strong> Your coach generates a
              structured plan with phases, progression, and daily workout
              templates written in plain English
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px">

            ⚡ What Shipped This Week
          </h2>
          <p>
            This release is <strong>Phase 1</strong> – the infrastructure and
            ability to create training programs through conversation. You can
            build complete programs with your coach right now. Phase 2 (viewing
            your program calendar, tracking adherence, logging from templates)
            ships next.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px">Behind the scenes, we built:</p>
          <ul style="margin-top: 10px">
            <li>
              <strong>Smart calendar generation:</strong> Your program knows
              "today's workout" based on YOUR timezone, not server time. Handles
              rest days, pauses, and real-world schedule chaos.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase-aware AI:</strong> Your coach understands where you
              are in the program and what comes next. They can intelligently
              adapt workouts based on your current phase goals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Semantic search integration:</strong> Training programs
              get stored in Pinecone so your coach can reference past programs,
              learn from what worked, and avoid what didn't.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Async generation:</strong> Program building happens in the
              background while your coach keeps you updated with real-time
              progress messages. No waiting around.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px">
            <em

              engineering that made it feel effortless.</em

        <h2>🔧 UI Polish & Navigation Upgrades</h2>
        <p>Because good infrastructure deserves a good interface:</p>

            <strong>Redesigned sidebar navigation</strong> with hover-based
            flyout menu for utility items – way cleaner on desktop
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mode toggle component</strong> that's perfectly aligned,
            properly styled, and feels buttery smooth to click
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consistent icon sizing</strong> across all navigation items
            in collapsed sidebar view
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Centralized UI patterns</strong> for dividers, spacing, and
