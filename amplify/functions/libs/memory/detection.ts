TASK: Determine if the user's message would benefit from accessing their stored preferences, goals, constraints, or past context.

MEMORY CONTEXT INDICATORS:
- Direct memory queries ("do you remember", "remember my", "what do you remember about", "did I tell you about")
- References to personal preferences ("I like/hate", "works for me", "my preference")
- Goal-related discussions ("my goal", "trying to", "working towards", "want to achieve")
- Constraint mentions ("I can't", "limited time", "only have", "schedule constraints")
- Emotional/motivational states that might have past patterns ("feeling frustrated", "struggling", "motivated")
- Past reference patterns ("remember when", "you told me", "we discussed", "like before")
- Requests for personalized advice that would benefit from knowing user context
- Questions about progress, patterns, or consistency
- Mentions of specific preferences, limitations, or approaches

CONTEXT TYPES:
- preference: Training preferences, exercise likes/dislikes, communication style
- goal: Fitness goals, targets, aspirations, motivations
- constraint: Physical limitations, time constraints, equipment limitations, schedule
- instruction: Specific coaching approaches or methods the user prefers
- context: Personal background, lifestyle factors, emotional patterns
- motivational: Past emotional states, motivation patterns, support strategies

CRITICAL: This function should ONLY be called for content that has already been identified as a memory request.
DO NOT process workout performance logs - these are handled by the workout logging system and stored separately in Pinecone and DynamoDB.

MEMORY TYPES:
- preference: Training preferences, communication style, etc.
- goal: Fitness goals, targets, aspirations
- constraint: Physical limitations, time constraints, equipment limitations
- instruction: Specific coaching instructions or approaches
- context: Personal context, background, lifestyle factors

IMPORTANCE LEVELS:
- high: Critical for coaching, safety-related, or core preferences
- medium: Helpful context that improves coaching quality
- low: Nice to know information, minor preferences

SCOPE DETERMINATION:
COACH-SPECIFIC memories are about:
- Coaching style preferences and feedback ("I like when Marcus gives detailed technical cues")
- Communication style preferences ("Your motivational approach works well for me")
- Methodology-specific interactions ("In CrossFit, I need you to remind me about pacing")
- Coach relationship dynamics ("You push me the right amount", "I respond better to your encouragement")
- Coaching technique feedback ("I prefer when you demonstrate movements")
- Program-specific context tied to this coach's approach

GLOBAL memories apply to ALL coaches and are about:
- Physical constraints and injuries ("I have a shoulder injury")
- Equipment, time, location constraints ("I train at home with limited equipment")
- Goals and aspirations ("I want to deadlift 315 pounds")
- Personal context and lifestyle ("I'm a busy parent with two kids")
- General training preferences ("I prefer morning workouts")
- Dietary restrictions or preferences
- Past training history and experience

TAG SUGGESTIONS:
Select 3-5 relevant tags from these categories:

CONTENT TAGS:
- preference: Training preferences, likes/dislikes
- goal: Fitness goals, targets, aspirations
- constraint: Limitations, restrictions, boundaries
- instruction: Coaching directions, methodologies
- context: Personal background, lifestyle factors

CONTEXT TAGS:
- workout_planning: Program design, scheduling, periodization
- form_analysis: Technique, movement quality, corrections
- motivation: Mental state, encouragement, drive
- scheduling: Time management, availability, timing
- nutrition: Diet, supplements, fueling
- injury_management: Pain, recovery, modifications
- equipment: Gear, tools, facility access
- communication: Feedback style, interaction preferences

SCOPE TAGS:
- coach_specific: Tied to specific coach relationship
- global: Applies to all coaches
- methodology_specific: Tied to training approach

TEMPORAL TAGS:
- morning: Morning-related preferences/constraints
- evening: Evening-related preferences/constraints
- weekend: Weekend-specific activities/constraints
- seasonal: Seasonal variations, weather-related

IMPORTANCE TAGS:
- critical: Safety-critical, must-know information
- important: High-value context for coaching
- helpful: Nice-to-know additional context

EXERCISE DETECTION:
If the memory mentions specific exercises, add relevant exercise tags:
- Exercise names: "lunges" ‚Üí ["lunge", "lower_body", "functional"]
- Exercise types: "I love compound movements" ‚Üí ["compound", "preference"]
- Body parts: "I prefer upper body exercises" ‚Üí ["upper_body", "preference"]
- Equipment: "I only have dumbbells" ‚Üí ["dumbbell", "equipment", "constraint"]

EXERCISE TAG CATEGORIES:
- Exercise names: squat, deadlift, lunge, push_up, pull_up, bench_press, overhead_press, row, curl, extension, lateral_raise, tricep_dip, etc.
- Exercise types: compound, isolation, functional, cardio, plyometric, isometric
- Body parts: upper_body, lower_body, core, chest, back, shoulders, arms, legs, glutes, abs, quads, hamstrings, calves
- Equipment: bodyweight, dumbbell, barbell, kettlebell, machine, cable, resistance_band, medicine_ball
- Movement patterns: push, pull, squat, hinge, lunge, carry, rotation, lateral, vertical, horizontal

CRITICAL RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
1. RESPOND WITH PURE JSON ONLY - NO MARKDOWN, NO BACKTICKS, NO EXPLANATIONS
2. START IMMEDIATELY WITH { AND END WITH }
3. DO NOT WRAP IN TRIPLE BACKTICKS OR ANY OTHER FORMATTING
4. INCLUDE ALL REQUIRED FIELDS EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED

REQUIRED JSON STRUCTURE:

    "scope": "brief explanation of why this is coach-specific or global",
    "tags": "brief explanation of tag choices",
    "exercises": "brief explanation of exercise tags"
  }
}

CRITICAL TYPE SELECTION RULE:
- You MUST choose EXACTLY ONE type from: preference, goal, constraint, instruction, context
- DO NOT use compound types like "preference|constraint" or "goal|preference"
- If a memory has multiple aspects, choose the PRIMARY/DOMINANT type
- For safety-related items (injuries, limitations), always choose "constraint"
- For training preferences (timing, style), choose "preference"

GUIDELINES:
- Default to "preference", "medium", and global (false) if unsure
- Safety/injury constraints are always "high" importance and global
- Goals are typically "medium" or "high" importance and global
- Coach-specific memories should have clear references to coaching relationship or style
- Be conservative: most user context should be global unless explicitly about coaching relationship
- Select tags that will help with memory retrieval and context understanding
- Prioritize tags that describe the content and context, not just the type
- Include 3-5 tags maximum to avoid tag bloat
- For exercise-related memories, include relevant exercise tags (exercise names, body parts, equipment, movement patterns)
- Exercise tags should capture the specific exercises mentioned and their characteristics
- If no exercises are mentioned, leave exerciseTags as an empty array []`;

TASK: Analyze the user's message to determine:
1. Whether retrieving past memories would enhance the coaching response
2. Whether the user is requesting to save/remember something
3. If memory saving is needed, classify the memory characteristics

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

=== MEMORY RETRIEVAL ASSESSMENT ===
Retrieval is beneficial for:
- Questions about past workouts, goals, or preferences
- References to previous conversations or coaching approaches
- Progress comparisons or trend analysis requests
- Personalized advice requests that benefit from context
- Form or technique questions that reference past issues
- Goal-setting discussions that build on previous conversations

Context Types for Retrieval:
- goals: Goal-setting, aspirations, targets
- preferences: Training preferences, communication style
- constraints: Physical limitations, time constraints, equipment
- progress: Past achievements, improvements, setbacks
- techniques: Form issues, technique preferences, coaching cues
- motivation: Motivational triggers, inspiration sources

=== MEMORY REQUEST DETECTION ===
User wants to save something when they:
- Explicitly ask: "Remember that I...", "I want you to know...", "For future reference..."
- Share important preferences: "I prefer...", "I don't like...", "I work best with..."
- Set goals or constraints: "My goal is...", "I can't do...", "I have limited time..."
- Give coaching instructions: "When I do X, remind me to...", "Always check my form on..."
- Use slash commands: "/save-memory [content]"

CRITICAL: DO NOT DETECT WORKOUT LOGS AS MEMORY REQUESTS
Workouts are already stored in two separate systems:
1. Pinecone: Stores workout summaries for semantic search and progress tracking
2. DynamoDB: Stores complete workout records with full details

DO NOT save as memories:
- Workout performance data (e.g., "I did Fran in 8:57", "Deadlifted 315 for 5 reps")
- Exercise logs with sets, reps, weights, times, or distances
- Training session reports or workout completions
- Slash commands like "/log-workout" (handled by workout system)
- Messages that are primarily about logging today's training activity

These are handled by the workout logging system (/log-workout) and should NEVER trigger memory saves.

EXCEPTION: Future workout goals ARE memories (e.g., "I want to deadlift 315 by June" = goal memory)
Only the GOAL is a memory, not the actual workout performance when achieved.

=== MEMORY CHARACTERISTICS (if memory request detected) ===
Memory Types:
- preference: Training preferences, communication style, workout timing
- goal: Fitness goals, targets, aspirations, milestones
- constraint: Physical limitations, time constraints, equipment limitations
- instruction: Specific coaching instructions, form cues, reminders

Importance Levels:
- high: Critical for safe and effective coaching (injuries, major goals, key preferences)
- medium: Important for personalized coaching (preferences, minor constraints)
- low: Nice-to-have context (casual preferences, general information)

Scope Determination:
- isCoachSpecific: true if the memory is specific to this coaching relationship
- isCoachSpecific: false if it's general user information applicable to any coach

Suggested Tags: Relevant keywords for easy retrieval (max 5 tags)
