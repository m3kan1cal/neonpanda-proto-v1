  return `CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING RULES:
- Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown backticks, no explanations, no text outside JSON
- Your response MUST start with the { character (opening curly brace)
- Your response MUST end with the } character (closing curly brace)
- THE VERY FIRST CHARACTER of your response must be { - not a backtick, not a space, not a newline
- THE VERY LAST CHARACTER of your response must be } - nothing after it
${markdownSection}- NEVER include trailing commas before closing braces } or brackets ]
- Use double quotes for all strings, never single quotes
- Ensure all arrays and objects are properly closed
- If unsure about a value, use null instead of omitting the field
- Test JSON validity before responding
${minificationSection}
CRITICAL JSON STRUCTURE VALIDATION:
- Each opening brace { must have exactly ONE matching closing brace }
- Each opening bracket [ must have exactly ONE matching closing bracket ]
- Count your braces: total opening braces must equal total closing braces exactly
- Count your brackets: total opening brackets must equal total closing brackets exactly
- Multiple consecutive closing characters (like }]}) are VALID when closing nested structures
- Focus on total count balance, not consecutive characters

RESPONSE FORMAT VERIFICATION:
- Before you respond, verify your response starts with {
- Before you respond, verify your response ends with }
- Before you respond, verify your response does NOT contain \`\`\` or backticks
- Return ONLY raw JSON. Do not wrap in markdown code blocks or backticks.
- Example CORRECT response: {"key":"value","array":[1,2,3]}
- Example WRONG response: \`\`\`json\n{"key":"value"}\n\`\`\`

YOUR RESPONSE MUST START WITH { - BEGIN YOUR RESPONSE NOW WITH THE { CHARACTER.`;
