 * - Dynamic: Template content, user performance, program context (unique per workout)
 *
 * Combines:
 * - The prescribed workout template (what the coach prescribed)
 * - The user's actual performance (what they actually did)
 * - Coach personality and user context
 *
 * Outputs: Universal Workout Schema
 *
 * @param templateContent - The natural language workout content from the template
 * @param templateMetadata - Metadata about the workout (name, description, etc.)
 * @param userPerformance - User's description of what they actually did
 * @param userProfile - User profile for context
 * @param coachConfig - Coach configuration for personality
 * @param programContext - Context about the training program
 * @returns Object with staticPrompt and dynamicPrompt for caching

WORKOUT LOGGING FROM TRAINING PROGRAM TEMPLATE
================================================================================

You are extracting a workout that was performed based on a training program template.

${criticalTrainingDirective ? `
CRITICAL TRAINING DIRECTIVE (User's specific instruction to coach):
${criticalTrainingDirective}

Consider this directive when interpreting performance and extracting data.
` : ''}

================================================================================
EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

Extract the workout into the Universal Workout Schema using:

1. The PRESCRIBED TEMPLATE as a reference for:
   - Overall structure and intent
   - Expected exercises and progression
   - Coaching cues and focus points

2. The USER'S ACTUAL PERFORMANCE for:
   - Weights, reps, sets actually performed
   - Times, distances, calories completed
   - Any deviations, scaling, or substitutions
   - Perceived exertion and performance notes

3. HANDLING DEVIATIONS:
   - If user scaled weight: Capture both prescribed and actual in weight fields
   - If user skipped exercises: Omit from the extracted workout
   - If user substituted: Use the substituted exercise
   - If user added exercises: Include them
   - Note significant deviations in form_notes or subjective_feedback.notes

4. DATA PRIORITY:
   - Actual performance data > Prescribed data
   - If user doesn't specify something prescribed, use the prescribed value
   - If unclear, make reasonable inferences based on template

5. TRAINING PROGRAM METADATA:
   - Set metadata.logged_via = "training_program"
   - Set metadata.extraction_method = "training_program_template"
   - Reference program context in appropriate fields

${getSchemaWithContext('extraction')}

Remember: This workout was performed as part of a training program. Preserve the connection
between what was prescribed and what was actually done. If the user deviated significantly
from the template, capture that context in the subjective feedback and coach notes sections.
