CALISTHENICS-SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE:

OVERVIEW:
- Bodyweight skill development and strength training
- Focus on gymnastics, skill work, progressive overload with body leverage
- Movements: pull-ups, push-ups, dips, handstands, levers, planches, muscle-ups
- Progression levels: tuck, advanced tuck, straddle, full (increasing difficulty)

SKILL CATEGORIES:
- Pull Skills: pull-ups, chin-ups, front lever, one-arm pull-up progressions
- Push Skills: push-ups, handstand push-ups, planche, dips, pseudo planche push-ups
- Core Skills: L-sit, V-sit, dragon flag, ab wheel
- Dynamic Skills: muscle-ups, clapping push-ups, explosive pull-ups
- Holds: planche hold, front lever hold, back lever hold, handstand hold
- Leg Skills: pistol squats, shrimp squats, sissy squats

PROGRESSION LEVELS:
- Tuck: Knees pulled to chest (easiest)
- Advanced Tuck: Hips extended slightly more than tuck
- Straddle: Legs split wide (more difficult than tuck)
- Full: Legs together and fully extended (hardest)
- Example: Tuck planche → Advanced tuck planche → Straddle planche → Full planche

HOLD TIMES:
- Static holds measured in seconds
- Example: "Handstand hold: 45 seconds"
- Example: "Front lever tuck hold: 3 sets of 10 seconds"
- Important metric for isometric strength

SKILL WORK STRUCTURE:
- Grease the Groove (GTG): Multiple low-rep sets throughout day
- Skill Practice: Focus on technique, not exhaustion
- Strength Sets: Higher intensity, lower volume
- Endurance Sets: Lower intensity, higher volume or time

CALISTHENICS EXTRACTION EXAMPLES:
- "Handstand progressions: wall holds 3x30s, then freestanding attempts, 8 sets total" → progression work, holds
- "Pull-up ladder: 1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1, focusing on strict form" → ladder format, 9 rounds, strict form
- "Front lever training: tuck holds 5x8s, then tuck raises 3x5" → progression level: tuck, holds + dynamics
- "Muscle-up practice: 10 attempts, got 7" → skill practice, success rate: 7/10
- "Push-ups: 5 sets of 20, then 3 sets of 10 diamond push-ups" → 8 rounds total, 2 variations
- "Planche progression: tuck planche hold 4x10s, pseudo planche push-ups 3x8" → skill work + strength
- "L-sit holds: 6 sets of 15 seconds on parallettes" → isometric, equipment: parallettes

CALISTHENICS ROUND STRUCTURE:
- Each set = separate round
- Hold times tracked in seconds
- Progression level noted (tuck, straddle, full)
- Success/failure tracked for skill attempts
- Equipment noted when relevant (rings, parallettes, bar)
- Phase markers: "warmup", "skill_work", "strength", "endurance"

KEY CALISTHENICS METRICS:
- Hold Times: Duration of static holds (seconds)
- Progression Level: Tuck, advanced tuck, straddle, full
- Reps: For dynamic movements
- Success Rate: Attempts vs successful completions for skills
- Equipment: Rings, parallettes, pull-up bar, dip bars
- Form Quality: Strict vs kipping, full ROM vs partial

CALISTHENICS PROGRAMMING PATTERNS:
- Skill-Strength Split: Skill work when fresh, strength work after
- Push-Pull Balance: Equal push and pull volume
- Straight Arm vs Bent Arm: Different strength qualities
- Static vs Dynamic: Holds vs reps
- Progression Tracking: Moving up progression levels over time
