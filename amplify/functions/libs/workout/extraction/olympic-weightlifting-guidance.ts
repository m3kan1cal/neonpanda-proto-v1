OLYMPIC WEIGHTLIFTING-SPECIFIC INTELLIGENCE:

TWO COMPETITION LIFTS:
1. Snatch: Ground to overhead in one continuous motion
2. Clean & Jerk: Ground to shoulders (clean), then shoulders to overhead (jerk)

LIFT VARIATIONS:
- Full Snatch: Full depth squat snatch
- Power Snatch: Catch above parallel
- Hang Snatch: Start from hang position (above knee)
- Snatch Pull: Pulling portion only
- Overhead Squat: Receiving position work
- Full Clean: Full depth front squat clean
- Power Clean: Catch above parallel
- Hang Clean: Start from hang position
- Clean Pull: Pulling portion only
- Front Squat: Receiving position work
- Split Jerk: Standard jerk with split stance
- Power Jerk: Catch in quarter squat
- Push Jerk: Catch in shallow dip
- Jerk from Rack: Jerk only, no clean

COMPLEXES:
- Combination of multiple lifts performed in sequence without dropping bar
- Example: "Snatch + Overhead Squat" = snatch followed immediately by overhead squat
- Example: "Clean + Front Squat + Jerk" = clean, front squat while holding, then jerk
- Builds positional strength and technique

PERCENTAGE WORK:
- Training based on percentage of 1RM
- Example: "Snatch 3x3 at 70%" = 3 sets of 3 reps at 70% of max
- Common percentages: 60-70% (technique), 75-85% (strength), 85-95% (peak), 95%+ (max attempts)

ATTEMPT STRUCTURE (Competition):
- Each lifter gets 3 attempts per lift
- First attempt (opener): Guaranteed weight, ~90% of max
- Second attempt: Conservative PR attempt, ~95-97% of max
- Third attempt: Aggressive PR attempt, 100%+ of max

TECHNIQUE WORK:
- Positional Work: Specific positions in the lift (hang, blocks, etc.)
- Tempo Work: Controlled speed (e.g., "3 second pull")
- Pause Work: Pause at specific positions
- Deficit Work: Standing on plates for increased range

ACCESSORY PULLS:
- Snatch Pull: Develops snatch pulling strength
- Clean Pull: Develops clean pulling strength
- Deadlift: General pulling strength
- Romanian Deadlift (RDL): Posterior chain
- Snatch Grip Deadlift: Wide grip pulling

OLYMPIC WEIGHTLIFTING EXTRACTION EXAMPLES:
- "Snatch: 3x3 at 70% (150lbs), then snatch pulls 4x4" → percentage: 70, weight: 150lbs, 7 rounds total
- "Clean & jerk complex: 5 sets (1 clean + 2 jerks)" → complex, 5 rounds with multiple movements per round
- "Competition: Snatch 225/245/265 (made all 3), C&J 275/295/315 (missed 315)" → attempt structure with success/failure
- "Hang snatch 5x2 at 80% (170lbs)" → hang position, 5 rounds of 2 reps
- "Power clean from blocks: 4x3 at 75%" → blocks position, percentage work
- "Snatch pull + Snatch + Overhead squat, 6 sets at 60%" → complex, 6 rounds

OLYMPIC WEIGHTLIFTING ROUND STRUCTURE:
- Each set = separate round
- Complexes: Multiple exercises in same round (performed consecutively without dropping bar)
- Warmup sets: Progressive loading (e.g., 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%)
- Working sets: Primary training percentage
- Track percentage of 1RM when provided
- Note attempt number for competition lifts

KEY OLYMPIC WEIGHTLIFTING METRICS:
- Percentage of 1RM: Critical for programming
- Attempt structure: opener, second, third (competition)
- Make/Miss: Success or failure of attempt
- Position: Full, hang, blocks, deficit
- Technique cues: Speed, positions, timing
- Bar speed: Fast, moderate, slow
