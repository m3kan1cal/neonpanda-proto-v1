MESSAGE: "${message}"

${JSON_FORMATTING_INSTRUCTIONS_STANDARD}

REQUIRED JSON STRUCTURE:
{
  "isWorkoutLog": boolean,
  "confidence": number,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation"
}

STRICT WORKOUT LOGGING DETECTION CRITERIA:

ONLY classify as workout logging if ALL THREE requirements are met:

1. PAST TENSE COMPLETION: Message must explicitly indicate a workout WAS COMPLETED
   REQUIRED language patterns:
   - "I did [workout]" / "Did [workout]"
   - "I finished [workout]" / "Just finished [workout]" / "Finished [workout]"
   - "I completed [workout]" / "Completed [workout]"
   - "I crushed [workout]" / "Crushed [workout]"
   - "I performed [workout]" / "Performed [workout]"
   - "I trained [workout]" / "Trained [workout]"
   - "I got through [workout]" / "Got through [workout]"
   - "I knocked out [workout]" / "Knocked out [workout]"

   AVOID: "will do", "going to", "planning", "want to", "should I", "might do"

2. SPECIFIC WORKOUT CONTENT: Must contain concrete workout details
   REQUIRED content (at least one):
   - Specific times: "8:57", "30 minutes", "45 seconds"
   - Weights/loads: "315 lbs", "50kg", "bodyweight", "135#"
   - Reps/rounds: "5 rounds", "20 reps", "3 sets", "AMRAP"
   - Named workouts: "Fran", "Murph", "Cindy", "Helen"
   - Distances: "3 miles", "5k", "400m"
   - Specific exercises: "deadlifts", "thrusters", "pull-ups"
   - Workout structures: "21-15-9", "EMOM", "tabata"

   AVOID: Vague references like "worked out", "exercised", "trained hard"

3. EXPLICIT LOGGING INTENT: Clear intent to record/document the completed workout
   REQUIRED intent patterns:
   - "I did [specific workout details]"
   - "Just finished [specific workout details]"
   - "Completed [specific workout details]"
   - "Today's workout: [specific details]"
   - "My workout today: [specific details]"
   - "This morning I did [specific details]"
   - "Workout done: [specific details]"
   - "Training session complete: [specific details]"

   LOGGING REQUEST language (even more explicit):
   - "Log this workout:"
   - "Track this:"
   - "Record my workout:"
   - "Add this to my log:"
   - "Save this workout:"
   - "Document this session:"

   AVOID: Questions, discussions, experiences, feelings, commentary

EXAMPLES THAT SHOULD BE DETECTED AS WORKOUT LOGS:
[YES] "I did Fran today in 8:57"
[YES] "Just finished my deadlift session - 5x3 at 315lbs"
[YES] "Completed a 5k run this morning in 24:30"
[YES] "Today's workout: 3 rounds of burpees and squats"
[YES] "Crushed that EMOM - 10 minutes of thrusters"
[YES] "Did 21-15-9 of pull-ups and push-ups"
[YES] "Log this workout: 5 rounds of Cindy"
[YES] "Record my training: back squats 3x5 at 275lbs"
[YES] "Track this: 30-minute bike ride"
[YES] "Workout done: bench press and rows"

EXAMPLES THAT SHOULD NOT BE DETECTED (casual conversation):
[NO] "I felt strong during squats" (discussing experience, no completion language)
[NO] "The thrusters were tough today" (commentary on difficulty, not logging)
[NO] "I'm sore from yesterday's deadlifts" (discussing recovery, not logging)
[NO] "Should I do Murph this week?" (future planning question)
[NO] "What did I do last Tuesday?" (asking about past, not logging new)
[NO] "How was your workout?" (asking about others)
[NO] "I love doing burpees" (expressing preferences)
[NO] "My form felt off on squats" (technique discussion)
[NO] "I want to work on pull-ups" (future goals, not completed workout)
[NO] "The gym was crowded today" (general discussion)
[NO] "That workout looks hard" (commenting on future workout)
[NO] "I'm thinking about doing Fran" (considering, not completed)
[NO] "Deadlifts are my favorite" (preference discussion)

CRITICAL EXCLUSION PATTERNS:
- Question words: "what", "how", "when", "where", "why", "should", "can", "could"
- Future tense: "will", "going to", "planning", "want to", "need to"
- Conditional: "if I", "maybe", "thinking about", "considering"
- Discussion: "I like", "I prefer", "I think", "I feel"
- Experience sharing: "it was", "felt like", "seemed", "appeared"
- Advice seeking: "recommendations", "suggestions", "help", "tips"

CONFIDENCE SCORING:
- 0.9+: Clear past tense + specific details + explicit logging language
- 0.7-0.9: Past tense + workout content but less explicit logging intent
- 0.5-0.7: Ambiguous but contains some workout logging elements
- <0.5: Missing key requirements or clearly not workout logging

CRITICAL: When in doubt, DO NOT classify as workout logging. It's better to miss a workout log than create false positives from casual fitness conversation.`;
