TRAINING PROGRAM STRUCTURE EXTRACTION CONTEXT:
You must extract training program structure from the conversation into this exact JSON structure.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Ensure phases cover the entire program duration (phases should span from day 1 to totalDays)
- Phase startDay and endDay must be consecutive and non-overlapping
- Phase 1 should always start at day 1
- Training frequency should match what was discussed (typically 3-6 days per week)
- Equipment constraints should only include equipment that was explicitly mentioned
- Focus areas should be specific and actionable (e.g., "strength", "power", "conditioning", "technique")
- startDate should typically be today's date (will be set by system if not provided)
- dailyWorkoutTemplates should be an empty array (workouts generated separately per phase)

WORKOUT TEMPLATE GENERATION - NATURAL LANGUAGE APPROACH:

Write each workout as a human coach would write it - clear, detailed, motivational, and specific.
Think of how a great coach writes workouts: natural prose, not structured data or JSON.

PHASE CONTEXT:
- Phase: ${phaseContext.phaseName}
- Description: ${phaseContext.phaseDescription}
- Duration: ${phaseContext.phaseDurationDays} days
- Starting at day: ${phaseContext.phaseStartDay}
- Program: ${phaseContext.programName}
- Training Frequency: ${phaseContext.trainingFrequency}x per week
- Available Equipment: ${phaseContext.equipment.join(', ')}
- Program Goals: ${phaseContext.goals.join(', ')}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR workoutContent FIELD:

1. WRITE AS A COACH WRITES:
   - Use natural language, not JSON or structured formats
   - Be specific with all exercise details (sets, reps, weights, rest periods)
   - Include coaching cues, form focus, and intensity guidance
   - Structure clearly with sections (Warmup, Strength, Conditioning, etc.)
   - Add motivational language and context

2. EXAMPLE workoutContent (THIS IS THE STYLE TO EMULATE):
   "
   Warmup (10 minutes):
   Hip circles, leg swings, deep squat holds, PVC pass-throughs. Get the hips and
   shoulders mobile before we load them.

   Strength Block:
   Back Squat 5x5 @ 205lbs (75% of your estimated 1RM ~275lbs)
   Focus on hitting depth consistently every rep. Feel your weight shift to mid-foot
   at the bottom. Keep chest up throughout the movement. Rest 3 minutes between sets.
   Film your heavy set if possible - I want to see depth consistency.

   Scale: If form breaks, reduce weight 10% immediately.

   Bulgarian Split Squat 3x10 each leg @ 40lb dumbbells
   10 reps per leg. Focus on front leg doing the work. Keep torso upright.
   Rest 90 seconds between sets.

   Conditioning Finisher:
   EMOM 10: 10 calories assault bike
   Moderate paceâ€”should finish with 20-30 seconds rest. This is conditioning work,
   not a sprint. Keep breathing controlled.
   "

3. STRUCTURE & CLARITY:
   - Use clear sections (Warmup, Main Work, Accessory, Finisher, etc.)
   - Break complex workouts into digestible chunks
   - Include rest periods and timing guidance
   - Specify weights with context (% of 1RM, scaling options)

4. COACHING ELEMENTS:
   - Form cues for key movements
   - Intensity guidance (RPE, "should feel like X")
   - Scaling/modification options
   - What to focus on mentally
   - When to stop or reduce weight

5. prescribedExercises FIELD (LIGHTWEIGHT):
   - This is OPTIONAL and minimal
   - Include only main exercises for filtering/reference
   - Just exerciseName and movementType
   - Example: [{"exerciseName": "Back Squat", "movementType": "barbell"}]

6. coachingNotes FIELD:
   - Additional context not in workoutContent
   - Scaling options, intensity reminders
   - Connection to program goals
   - What to watch for today

GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate exactly ${phaseContext.phaseDurationDays} daily templates
- Day numbers: ${phaseContext.phaseStartDay} to ${phaseContext.phaseStartDay + phaseContext.phaseDurationDays - 1} (sequential)
- Training ${phaseContext.trainingFrequency}x per week - include rest/recovery days
- Rest days: templateType "optional", brief mobility/stretching in workoutContent
- Progressive overload: difficulty increases throughout phase
- Equipment: ONLY use from [${phaseContext.equipment.join(', ')}]
- templateId format: "template_day{dayNumber}_primary"
- scheduledDate: use empty string "" (calculated by system)
- phaseId: use "phase_1", "phase_2", etc.
- estimatedDuration: realistic (45-90 min training, 15-30 min rest days)
- Always set: status="pending", completedAt=null, linkedWorkoutId=null, userFeedback=null, adaptationHistory=[]
