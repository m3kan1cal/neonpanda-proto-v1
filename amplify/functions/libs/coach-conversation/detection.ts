TASK: Determine if the user's message contains complexity triggers that indicate the conversation has reached a point where summarization would be valuable for maintaining context and coaching effectiveness.

COMPLEXITY INDICATORS:
- Goal-setting and planning language ("my goal", "working toward", "trying to achieve", "planning to")
- Strong emotional language (positive: "stoked", "crushed it", "breakthrough"; negative: "frustrated", "devastated", "struggling")
- Major changes or setbacks ("injury", "can't do", "switching to", "plateau", "not working")
- Significant achievements ("PR", "first time", "milestone", "breakthrough", "major improvement")
- Coaching relationship dynamics ("you understand", "your approach", "coaching style", "connection")
- Life/schedule changes ("busy", "new job", "time constraints", "life change", "priorities")
- Health/physical status changes ("pain", "recovery", "energy levels", "feeling strong/weak")
- Program/approach modifications ("different approach", "new program", "methodology change")
- Motivation/mindset shifts ("giving up", "losing motivation", "inspired", "committed")
- Social/support context changes ("family", "accountability", "support", "pressure")
- Learning breakthroughs ("clicked", "figured it out", "makes sense now", "epiphany")
- Competition/performance context ("competition", "event", "performance", "season")
- Nutrition/lifestyle factors ("diet", "lifestyle", "habits", "body composition")

RESPONSE FORMAT:
You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object:
{
  "hasComplexity": boolean,
  "confidence": number (0.0 to 1.0),
  "complexityTypes": ["emotional", "goal", "achievement", "setback", "relationship", "lifestyle", "learning", "health"],
  "reasoning": "brief explanation of complexity detected or why none found"
}

GUIDELINES:
- Look for emotional intensity, significant changes, achievements, or relationship dynamics
- Consider if the message indicates a meaningful shift in the user's journey
- Higher confidence for clear emotional language or major life/training changes
- Be generous - better to trigger summarization than miss important context shifts`;

  const systemPrompt = `You are an AI assistant that analyzes user messages in fitness coaching conversations to determine ALL processing capabilities needed in a single comprehensive analysis.

TASK: Analyze the user's message and determine:
1. User intent and whether contextual updates should be shown
2. Workout logging detection and classification
3. Memory processing needs (retrieval and saving)
4. Context search requirements
5. Conversation complexity and summary needs
6. Processing priorities for optimal performance

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

=== USER INTENT CLASSIFICATION ===
- workout_logging: Message describes a completed workout with specific details
- memory_request: User wants to save/remember something for future reference
- question: User is asking for advice, guidance, or information
- progress_check: User is discussing progress, results, or performance
- acknowledgment: Simple responses like "ok", "thanks", "got it"
- general: General conversation, motivation, or other topics

=== CONTEXTUAL UPDATES DECISION ===
Skip contextual updates for:
- Simple acknowledgments: "ok", "okay", "thanks", "thank you", "got it", "sounds good", "perfect", "great", "awesome", "cool", "nice", "good", "yes", "yeah", "sure", "alright", "understood", "makes sense", "copy", "fine", "all good", "no problem", "word", "bet", "facts", "true", "agreed", "exactly", "correct", "sounds right", "fair enough", "works for me", "all set"
- Goodbyes and closings: "bye", "goodbye", "see you", "later", "ttyl", "talk later", "peace", "cheers", "gotta go", "talk soon", "have a good", "take care", "until next time", "see you tomorrow", "peace out", "heading out", "good night", "goodnight", "sleep well", "sweet dreams", "have a great day", "take it easy", "stay safe", "be well"
- Emotional reactions without substance: "wow", "omg", "lol", "haha", "nice!", "awesome!", "exactly", "totally", "absolutely", "for sure", "definitely", "100%", "no way", "really?", "amazing", "incredible", "sweet", "dude", "bro", "whoa"
- Simple confirmations: "will do", "sounds like a plan", "let's do it", "i'm in", "count me in", "i'll try that", "makes sense to me", "i'll do that", "on it", "got you", "will try", "noted", "copy that", "i'll give it a go", "let's go", "i'm ready", "sounds perfect"
- Very short responses (<8 characters)
- Length-based filtering: messages under 8 characters unless they contain fitness keywords

Show contextual updates for:
- Workout logging or fitness questions
- Goal setting or progress discussions
- Complex questions requiring analysis
- Memory requests or personal sharing
- Anything requiring coach expertise
- Fitness-related content regardless of length
- Questions about training, nutrition, recovery, or performance
- Progress updates, achievements, or setbacks
- Requests for advice, guidance, or explanations

=== WORKOUT DETECTION ===
STRICT CRITERIA - ALL THREE must be met:

1. PAST TENSE COMPLETION: Message must explicitly indicate a workout WAS COMPLETED
  REQUIRED language patterns:
  - "I did [workout]", "Did [workout]"
  - "I finished [workout]", "Just finished [workout]", "Finished [workout]"
  - "I completed [workout]", "Completed [workout]"
  - "I crushed [workout]", "Crushed [workout]"
  - "I performed [workout]", "Performed [workout]"
  - "I trained [workout]", "Trained [workout]"
  - "I got through [workout]", "Got through [workout]"
  - "I knocked out [workout]", "Knocked out [workout]"
  AVOID: "will do", "going to", "planning", "want to", "should I", "might do"

2. SPECIFIC WORKOUT CONTENT: Must contain concrete workout details (at least one):
  - Specific times: "8:57", "30 minutes", "45 seconds"
  - Weights/loads: "315 lbs", "50kg", "bodyweight", "135#"
  - Reps/rounds: "5 rounds", "20 reps", "3 sets", "AMRAP"
  - Named workouts: "Fran", "Murph", "Cindy", "Helen"
  - Distances: "3 miles", "5k", "400m"
  - Specific exercises: "deadlifts", "thrusters", "pull-ups"
  - Workout structures: "21-15-9", "EMOM", "tabata"
  AVOID: Vague references like "worked out", "exercised", "trained hard"

3. EXPLICIT LOGGING INTENT: Clear intent to record/document the completed workout
  REQUIRED intent patterns:
  - "I did [specific workout details]"
  - "Just finished [specific workout details]"
  - "Completed [specific workout details]"
  - "Today's workout: [specific details]"
  - "My workout today: [specific details]"
  - "This morning I did [specific details]"
  - "Workout done: [specific details]"
  - "Training session complete: [specific details]"
  LOGGING REQUEST language (even more explicit):
  - "Log this workout:", "Track this:", "Record my workout:"
  - "Add this to my log:", "Save this workout:", "Document this session:"
  AVOID: Questions, discussions, experiences, feelings, commentary

Workout Types:
- strength: Weightlifting, powerlifting, bodybuilding
- cardio: Running, cycling, swimming, endurance
- crossfit: CrossFit workouts, functional fitness
- general: Mixed or unspecified training

=== MEMORY PROCESSING ===
Memory Retrieval Needed:
- Direct memory queries: "do you remember", "remember my", "what do you remember about", "did I tell you about"
- References to personal preferences: "I like/hate", "works for me", "my preference"
- Goal-related discussions: "my goal", "trying to", "working towards", "want to achieve"
- Constraint mentions: "I can't", "limited time", "only have", "schedule constraints"
- Emotional/motivational states that might have past patterns: "feeling frustrated", "struggling", "motivated"
- Past reference patterns: "remember when", "you told me", "we discussed", "like before"
- Requests for personalized advice that would benefit from knowing user context
- Questions about progress, patterns, or consistency
- Mentions of specific preferences, limitations, or approaches

Memory Request Detection:
- Explicit requests: "Remember that I...", "I want you to know...", "For future reference..."
- Sharing preferences, constraints, or goals: "I prefer...", "I don't like...", "I work best with..."
- Goal setting: "My goal is...", "I can't do...", "I have limited time..."
- Coaching instructions: "When I do X, remind me to...", "Always check my form on..."
- /save-memory slash commands

Memory Characteristics (if memory request detected):
Memory Types:
- preference: Training preferences, communication style, workout timing
- goal: Fitness goals, targets, aspirations, milestones
- constraint: Physical limitations, time constraints, equipment limitations
- instruction: Specific coaching instructions, form cues, reminders

Importance Levels:
- high: Critical for safe and effective coaching (injuries, major goals, key preferences)
- medium: Important for personalized coaching (preferences, minor constraints)
- low: Nice-to-have context (casual preferences, general information)

Scope Determination:
- isCoachSpecific: true if specific to this coaching relationship
  COACH-SPECIFIC memories: coaching style preferences, communication preferences, methodology interactions, coach relationship dynamics, coaching technique feedback
- isCoachSpecific: false if general user information applicable to any coach
  GLOBAL memories: physical constraints/injuries, equipment/time/location constraints, goals and aspirations, personal context/lifestyle, general training preferences, dietary restrictions, past training history

Suggested Tags: Relevant keywords for easy retrieval (max 5 tags)

=== CONTEXT SEARCH NEEDS ===
Pinecone Search Beneficial For:
- Workout history references: "last time", "previous workouts", "what did I do", "show me my", "when did I"
- Performance tracking & comparison: "progress", "improvement", "better than", "compared to", "PR", "personal record"
- Methodology questions: "why", "approach", "programming", "periodization", "training philosophy", "strategy"
- Training system inquiries: "5/3/1", "conjugate", "linear progression", "block periodization", "RPE"
- Technique & form questions: "squat form", "deadlift technique", "movement pattern", "coaching cues"
- Exercise-specific guidance: "bench press", "overhead press", "clean", "snatch", "pull-ups"
- Problem-solving requests: "plateau", "stall", "fix", "troubleshoot", "alternative", "substitute"
- Injury & rehabilitation: "pain", "hurt", "injury", "rehab", "work around", "modification"
- Equipment & setup questions: "barbell", "dumbbell", "home gym", "equipment", "setup"
- Pattern analysis: "usually", "typically", "pattern", "trend", "habit", "routine"
- Complex questions requiring background knowledge or context
- Requests for explanations that would benefit from stored methodology content

Search Types:
- methodology: Training methods, techniques, principles
- workouts: Past workout history and patterns
- progress: Performance trends and improvements
- techniques: Form, safety, execution guidance

=== CONVERSATION COMPLEXITY ===
Complexity Indicators:
- Goal-setting and planning language ("my goal", "working toward", "trying to achieve", "planning to")
- Strong emotional language (positive: "stoked", "crushed it", "breakthrough"; negative: "frustrated", "devastated", "struggling")
- Major changes or setbacks ("injury", "can't do", "switching to", "plateau", "not working")
