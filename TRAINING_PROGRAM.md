SKELETON OF NEW TRAINING PROGRAM ORIGINAL:
**5x TOTAL BODY WORKOUTS PER WEEK**

**START EACH WORKOUT WITH A POSTERIOR CHAIN POWER EXERCISE**
(30% or less than your 1RM Deadlift weight, moving it as fast as you can)
2-4 sets, 2-8 reps

**SUPERSET THAT WITH AN ANTERIOR CHAIN EXERCISE**

**THEN DO A HINGE OR A SQUAT**
(80% or more of your 1RM to within two reps of failure)
2-4 sets, 2-10 reps

**THEN SUPERSET A PUSH AND PULL EXERCISE**
(70% or more of 1RM to within two reps of failure)
2-4 sets, 5-15 reps

**THEN PICK A LUNGE, SPLIT SQUAT, OR STEP UP**
2-4 sets, 6-12 reps

**THEN PICK TWO ACCESSORIES AND SUPERSET THEM**
2-4 sets, 6-20 reps

(1-2 hours of constant or near constant easy movement)

REFINED WEEKLY STRUCTURE
Based on Your Training Patterns & Preferences

3x STRENGTH-FOCUSED DAYS:
Primary lift progression (4-8 reps, building toward your 315/185 targets)
T2B attempts supersetted with main strength work (daily skill practice)
Push/pull superset (matching or exceeding pressing volume for balance)
8-12 minute conditioning finisher (rotating formats: EMOM, ladders, rounds)

2x HYBRID MOVEMENT DAYS:
Power start (2-4 sets, rotating: cleans/sandbag/landmine/jumps)
Anterior chain work (core-focused, moderate intensity)
Heavy hinge or squat (80%+ when fresh, scaled when managing fatigue)
Push/pull emphasis (maintaining horizontal pulling priority)
Conditioning block (12-20 minutes, creative formats you enjoy)
Flexibility to substitute unilateral/accessory phases with more conditioning

INTENSITY MANAGEMENT BUILT-IN:
Smart scaling protocols (like your Wednesday Zercher recovery)
Fatigue-based modifications (strength vs. conditioning emphasis)
Equipment rotation (barbell/DB/KB/hammer strength variety)

CONDITIONING DISTRIBUTION:
3-4 sessions: Short high-intensity finishers (8-15 minutes)
1 session: Longer conditioning emphasis (18-25 minutes)
1 session: Aerobic base work (rucking/running/family activities)

WEEKLY MOVEMENT PRIORITIES:
Daily T2B practice (building toward that breakthrough)
Power clean rotation (you loved the 175# progression)
Horizontal pulling emphasis (addressing last week's imbalance)
Weakness integration (burpee box jump-overs, push press, gymnastics)
