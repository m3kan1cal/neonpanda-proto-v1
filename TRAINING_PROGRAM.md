• Power clean momentum is excellent - continue building confidence at 175lbs

**WEEKLY MOVEMENT PRIORITIES:**
Daily T2B practice (building toward that breakthrough)
T2B skill work needs consistent daily integration
Power clean rotation (you loved the 175# progression)
Horizontal & vertical pulling emphasis
Weakness integration (burpee box jump-overs, push press, gymnastics, thrusters)
Hinge movement frequency too low
