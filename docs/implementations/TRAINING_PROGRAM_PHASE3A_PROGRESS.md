**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Status:** Phase 3A Core UI - In Progress (Day 1 Complete)

---

## Completed Today ✅

### 1. Constants & Configuration
**File:** `src/constants/conversationModes.js`
- ✅ `CONVERSATION_MODES` (CHAT, BUILD)
- ✅ `PROGRAM_STATUS` (ACTIVE, PAUSED, COMPLETED, ARCHIVED)
- ✅ `TEMPLATE_TYPES` (PRIMARY, OPTIONAL, RECOVERY)

### 2. Training Program API Utilities
**File:** `src/utils/apis/trainingProgramApi.js`
- ✅ `listTrainingPrograms(userId, coachId, options)` - List all programs with filtering
- ✅ `getTrainingProgram(userId, coachId, programId)` - Get program details
- ✅ `getTodaysWorkout(userId, coachId, programId)` - Get today's workout templates
- ✅ `getWorkoutTemplatesForDay(userId, coachId, programId, day)` - Get templates for specific day
- ✅ `updateTrainingProgram(userId, coachId, programId, body)` - Update program status
- ✅ `logWorkout(userId, coachId, programId, templateId, workoutData)` - Log completed workout
- ✅ `createTrainingProgram(userId, coachId, programData)` - Manual program creation

### 3. Training Program Agent (State Management)
**File:** `src/utils/agents/TrainingProgramAgent.js`
- ✅ Full state management for training programs
- ✅ Methods:
  - `loadTrainingPrograms(options)` - Load and filter programs (uses `listTrainingPrograms`)
  - `loadTrainingProgram(programId)` - Load program details (uses `getTrainingProgram`)
  - `loadTodaysWorkout(programId)` - Load today's workout
  - `updateProgramStatus(programId, action)` - Update status (uses `updateTrainingProgram`)
  - `logWorkoutFromTemplate(programId, templateId, workoutData)` - Log workout
  - `pauseProgram(programId)` - Pause program
  - `resumeProgram(programId)` - Resume program
  - `completeProgram(programId)` - Complete program
  - `archiveProgram(programId)` - Archive program
  - `getActiveProgram()` - Get current active program
  - `hasActiveProgram()` - Check if active program exists

### 4. Mode Toggle Component
**File:** `src/components/shared/CoachConversationModeToggle.jsx`
- ✅ Beautiful toggle between Chat and Build modes
- ✅ Disabled state during streaming
- ✅ Icons for each mode
- ✅ Smooth transitions and hover effects
- ✅ Dark mode support

### 5. Coach Conversations Integration
**File:** `src/components/CoachConversations.jsx`
- ✅ Imported mode toggle component
- ✅ Added conversation mode state
- ✅ Mode toggle positioned above chat input
- ✅ Mode syncs with loaded conversation
- ✅ Disabled during streaming/typing

### 6. API Updates for Mode Support
**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `src/utils/apis/coachConversationApi.js` - Added mode parameter to `createCoachConversation`
- ✅ `src/utils/agents/CoachConversationAgent.js` - Added mode parameter to `createConversation` method

---

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:
1. ✅ User opens coach conversation
2. ✅ Mode toggle appears above chat input (Chat / Build)
3. ✅ User can switch between modes:
   - **Chat mode**: Standard coaching conversation
   - **Build mode**: Guided training program creation
4. ✅ When creating new conversation, mode is passed to backend
5. ✅ When loading existing conversation, mode syncs automatically
6. ✅ Toggle is disabled during streaming to prevent mode changes mid-response

### Backend Integration:
- ✅ Mode parameter flows from frontend → API → Lambda → DynamoDB
- ✅ Existing conversations without mode default to 'chat'
- ✅ New conversations explicitly set mode based on user selection
- ✅ Build mode triggers enhanced AI prompt for program creation

## What's Left in Phase 3A

### Still To Build:
1. ⏳ **ProgramList.jsx** - Display user's programs with filtering
2. ⏳ **ProgramDetail.jsx** - Full program view with phases and progress
3. ⏳ **TodaysWorkout.jsx** - Prominent display of current day's workout
4. ⏳ **Supporting Components:**
   - `ProgramCard.jsx` - Individual program card for list view
   - `ProgramHeader.jsx` - Program header with name, status, dates
   - `ProgressBar.jsx` - Visual progress indicator
   - `PhasesTimeline.jsx` - Phase progression visualization
   - `ProgramControls.jsx` - Pause/resume/complete/archive buttons
   - `WorkoutTemplateCard.jsx` - Display workout template details
   - `LogWorkoutModal.jsx` - Modal for logging completed workouts

### Integration Points:
1. ⏳ FloatingMenuManager - Add programs section
2. ⏳ Training Grounds - Display active program and today's workout
3. ⏳ Program generation detection in streaming responses
4. ⏳ Success notifications for program creation

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Building Components
Build the remaining UI components (ProgramList, ProgramDetail, TodaysWorkout) to complete Phase 3A

### Option 2: Test What We Have
Test the mode toggle integration first to ensure it's working correctly before building more UI

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Test mode toggle now, then continue with remaining components

---

**Current Status:** ✅ Foundation complete, ready to build program UI or test mode toggle

**Estimated Time Remaining for Phase 3A:** 2-3 hours for remaining components
