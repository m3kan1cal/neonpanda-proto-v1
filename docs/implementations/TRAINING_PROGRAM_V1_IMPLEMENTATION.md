# Training Programs V1 Implementation Plan

## Overview

Training Programs allows users to create structured, multi-week training programs through conversational sessions with their AI coaches. This transforms the platform from individual workout generation to comprehensive training partnerships with long-term progression and coaching relationships.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Streaming Response Implementation (Week 1 Priority)

**Current Performance Issues:**
- 5-15 second wait times for coach responses
- Poor user engagement during response generation
- Uses non-streaming `bedrock.converse()` API

**Enhanced Streaming Backend:**
```typescript
// POST /users/{userId}/coaches/{coachId}/conversations/{sessionId}/send-message
// POST /users/{userId}/coaches/{coachId}/program-creator-sessions/{sessionId}/send-message

export async function streamCoachResponse(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const { message, userId, coachId, sessionId } = req.body;
  
  // Set up streaming response
  res.writeHead(200, {
    'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
    'Connection': 'keep-alive',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
  });

  try {
    // Get conversation context + memory
    const context = await buildConversationContext(userId, coachId, sessionId);
    
    // Stream response from Bedrock
    const stream = await bedrock.converseStream({
      modelId: 'claude-3-sonnet',
      messages: context.messages,
      system: context.systemPrompt
    });

    let fullResponse = '';
    
    for await (const chunk of stream.stream) {
      if (chunk.contentBlockDelta) {
        const deltaText = chunk.contentBlockDelta.delta.text;
        fullResponse += deltaText;
        
        // Send chunk to frontend
        res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ 
          type: 'chunk', 
          content: deltaText 
        })}\n\n`);
      }
    }
    
    // Send completion signal
    res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ 
      type: 'complete', 
      fullMessage: fullResponse 
    })}\n\n`);
    
    // Store complete message
    await storeCoachMessage(sessionId, fullResponse);
    
  } catch (error) {
    res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ 
      type: 'error', 
      message: error.message 
    })}\n\n`);
  } finally {
    res.end();
  }
}
```

**Enhanced CoachConversations.jsx:**
```jsx
function CoachConversations({ userId, coachId, conversationType, sessionId }) {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [streamingMessage, setStreamingMessage] = useState('');
  const [isStreaming, setIsStreaming] = useState(false);

  const sendMessage = async (userMessage) => {
    // Add user message immediately
    const newUserMessage = { role: 'user', content: userMessage };
    setMessages(prev => [...prev, newUserMessage]);
    
    // Start streaming coach response
    setIsStreaming(true);
    setStreamingMessage('');
    
    const endpoint = conversationType === 'program-creation'
      ? `/users/${userId}/coaches/${coachId}/program-creator-sessions/${sessionId}/send-message`
      : `/users/${userId}/coaches/${coachId}/conversations/${sessionId}/send-message`;

    try {
      const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ message: userMessage })
      });

      const reader = response.body.getReader();
      const decoder = new TextDecoder();
      
      while (true) {
        const { value, done } = await reader.read();
        if (done) break;
        
        const chunk = decoder.decode(value);
        const lines = chunk.split('\n');
        
        for (const line of lines) {
          if (line.startsWith('data: ')) {
            const data = JSON.parse(line.slice(6));
            
            if (data.type === 'chunk') {
              setStreamingMessage(prev => prev + data.content);
            } else if (data.type === 'complete') {
              // Add complete message to conversation
              const coachMessage = { role: 'assistant', content: data.fullMessage };
              setMessages(prev => [...prev, coachMessage]);
              setStreamingMessage('');
              setIsStreaming(false);
            }
          }
        }
      }
    } catch (error) {
      setIsStreaming(false);
      // Handle error
    }
  };

  // Different API endpoints based on conversation type
  const configStatus = conversationType === 'program-creation' 
    ? useConfigStatus(sessionId) 
    : null;

  return (
    <div className="conversation-container">
      {/* Program creation progress indicator */}
      {conversationType === 'program-creation' && (
        <ProgramCreationProgress configStatus={configStatus} />
      )}
      
      <div className="messages">
        {messages.map((message, index) => (
          <MessageBubble key={index} message={message} />
        ))}
        
        {/* Show streaming message */}
        {isStreaming && (
          <MessageBubble 
            message={{ role: 'assistant', content: streamingMessage }} 
            isStreaming={true}
          />
        )}
      </div>
      
      <MessageInput 
        onSendMessage={sendMessage} 
        disabled={isStreaming}
      />
      
      {/* Program creation specific footer */}
      {conversationType === 'program-creation' && configStatus?.finalized && (
        <ProgramFinalizationButton onFinalize={handleFinalize} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Performance Improvements:**
- **Before**: 5-15 second wait, then full response appears
- **After**: Response starts in ~1-2 seconds, streams in real-time
- **Program Creation**: Long program explanations stream naturally, feeling like active design
- **User Engagement**: Users stay engaged watching response build
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of partial responses and connection issues

### Enhanced Memory Integration

**Program Creation Context Queries:**
```typescript
const programContext = await queryPinecone({
  query: "user training goals, program preferences, past challenges, workout feedback",
  userId: userId,
  coachId: coachId,
  limit: 15
});
```

**Coach Learning Through Conversation Analysis:**
```typescript
// Analyze user response to challenges
const responseAnalysis = analyzeResponse(userResponse, {
  sentiment: true,
  receptivity: true,
  engagement: true
});

// Store effective challenge patterns
await storeChallengeOutcome({
  challengeType: "volume_excess",
  userResponse: responseAnalysis,
  effectiveness: calculateEffectiveness(responseAnalysis)
});
```

### Workout Generation Enhancement

**Program-Aware Context:**
```typescript
interface EnhancedWorkoutContext {
  // Existing context...
  
  programContext?: {
    programId: string,
    currentWeek: number,
    currentPhase: ProgramPhase,
    recentProgressions: Exercise[],
    upcomingMilestones: Milestone[],
    userFeedbackHistory: CheckIn[]
  }
}
```

**Coach Prompt Enhancement:**
```typescript
const workoutPrompt = `
You are generating Week ${programContext.currentWeek}, Day ${programContext.currentDay} 
of the user's "${programContext.name}" program.

Current Phase: ${programContext.currentPhase.name}
Phase Goals: ${programContext.currentPhase.goals}
Recent User Feedback: ${programContext.recentCheckIns}
Previous Workout Performance: ${programContext.lastWorkoutNotes}

Generate today's workout keeping the program progression in mind...
`;
```

### Cross-Discipline Coach Guidance

```typescript
// During program creation
if (coach.primaryDiscipline !== inferredProgramDiscipline) {
  const softGuidanceMessage = `
    I should mention - my expertise is really in ${coach.primaryDiscipline}. 
    I'm happy to create a ${inferredProgramDiscipline} program for you, but you 
    might get more specialized programming from a coach designed for that discipline. 
    Want to continue with me or create a specialized coach?
  `;
}
```
