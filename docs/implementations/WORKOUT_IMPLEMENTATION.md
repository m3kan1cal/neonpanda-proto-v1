# Workout Logging Implementation Guide
## Natural Language Workout Logging in Coach Conversations

### Version 1.0 | Implementation Reference

---

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation approach for natural language workout logging within coach conversations. Users can describe completed workouts in natural language during coach conversations, and the system will detect, extract, and store structured workout data using the Universal Workout Schema.

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Relationship Model
**Selected Approach**: Workouts belong to Users but track coach context

**Benefits**:
- User owns all their data
- Can switch coaches without losing workout history
- Maintains coaching context for analytics and personality
- Supports multiple coaches per user (future)
- Natural fit with conversation-based logging

### Entity Separation
- **Workout Template**: Prescribed workouts (future feature)
- **Workout**: Completed workouts (current implementation)

---

## Simplified Implementation Approach

### Initial Workout Structure

```typescript
interface Workout {
  workoutId: string;
  userId: string;

  // Coach context (simple single coach for now)
  coachIds: [string]; // Array with one element for future flexibility
  coachNames: [string]; // Array with one element for future flexibility

  conversationId: string;
  completedAt: Date; // When workout was actually completed
  workoutData: UniversalWorkoutSchema;

  extractionMetadata: {
    confidence: number;
    extractedAt: Date;
    reviewedBy?: string;
    reviewedAt?: Date;
  };
}
```

### DynamoDB Structure

```
// Workouts (completed workouts)
PK: user#{userId}
SK: workout#{workoutId}
GSI1PK: coach#{coachId}  // For any coach in the coachIds array
GSI1SK: user#{userId}#{completedAt}
```

---

## Implementation Flow

### 1. Detection in Coach Conversation

```typescript
// In send-coach-conversation-message/handler.ts
const isWorkoutLogging = detectWorkoutLogging(userResponse);

if (isWorkoutLogging) {
  // Quick extraction for immediate coach response
  const basicWorkoutInfo = await quickWorkoutExtraction(userResponse);

  // Coach acknowledges with personality
  const acknowledgment = await generateWorkoutAcknowledgment(
    coachConfig,
    basicWorkoutInfo,
    userResponse
  );

  // Start async full extraction
  await triggerAsyncWorkoutExtraction({
    userId,
    coachId,
    conversationId,
    userMessage: userResponse,
    coachConfig
  });

  return acknowledgment;
}
```

### 2. Workout Detection Logic

```typescript
const detectWorkoutLogging = (message: string) => {
  const workoutIndicators = [
    /did\s+\w+\s+today/i,
    /just\s+finished/i,
    /completed\s+\w+/i,
    /my\s+time\s+was/i,
    /\d+:\d+/, // Time format
    /\d+\s*(lbs?|kg|pounds?|kilos?)/i, // Weight format
    /(fran|murph|helen|diane|grace)/i, // CrossFit benchmarks
    /pr\s+today/i,
    /new\s+personal\s+best/i,
    /workout\s+complete/i,
    /finished\s+the\s+workout/i
  ];

  return workoutIndicators.some(pattern => pattern.test(message));
};
```

### 3. Coach Acknowledgment Generation

```typescript
const generateWorkoutAcknowledgment = async (
  coachConfig: CoachConfig,
  basicInfo: any,
  userMessage: string
) => {
  const prompt = `
  ${coachConfig.personality_prompt}

  The user just logged a workout: "${userMessage}"

  Basic extracted info: ${JSON.stringify(basicInfo)}

  Acknowledge this workout completion in your coaching style. Be encouraging and specific about what they accomplished. Keep it brief but personal.

  After acknowledging, you can ask 1-2 follow-up questions if key details are missing (time, weight, how it felt, etc.).
  `;

  return await callBedrockApi(prompt, userMessage);
};
```

### 4. Async Full Extraction

```typescript
// New Lambda: extract-workout/handler.ts
export const handler = async (event: any) => {
  const { userId, coachId, conversationId, userMessage, coachConfig } = event;

  // Full extraction using Universal Workout Schema
  const extractionPrompt = buildWorkoutExtractionPrompt(userMessage, coachConfig);
  const extractedData = await callBedrockApi(extractionPrompt, userMessage);

  // Parse and structure
  const workoutData = parseAndValidateWorkoutData(extractedData);

  // Create workout
  const workout = {
    workoutId: `ws_${userId}_${Date.now()}`,
    userId,
    coachIds: [coachId],
    coachNames: [coachConfig.name],
    conversationId,
    completedAt: extractCompletedAtTime(userMessage) || new Date(),
    workoutData,
    extractionMetadata: {
      confidence: calculateConfidence(workoutData),
      extractedAt: new Date()
    }
  };

  // Save to DynamoDB
  await saveWorkout(workout);

  // Store workout summary in Pinecone for semantic search and coach context
  const summary = await generateWorkoutSummary(workoutData, userMessage);
  await storeWorkoutSummaryInPinecone(userId, summary, workoutData, workout);

  return { success: true, workoutId: workout.workoutId };
};
```

### 5. Lambda Invocation Pattern

```typescript
// In send-coach-conversation-message/handler.ts
const triggerAsyncWorkoutExtraction = async (extractionData: any) => {
  const lambdaClient = new LambdaClient({});

  const command = new InvokeCommand({
    FunctionName: 'extract-workout',
    InvocationType: 'Event', // Async invocation
    Payload: JSON.stringify(extractionData)
  });

  await lambdaClient.send(command);
};
```

## Database Schema Implementation

### DynamoDB Operations

Add to `amplify/dynamodb/operations.ts`:

```typescript
export async function saveWorkout(workout: Workout): Promise<void> {
  const item = createDynamoDBItem<Workout>(
    'workout',
    `user#${workout.userId}`,
    `workout#${workout.workoutId}`,
    workout,
    new Date().toISOString()
  );

  await saveToDynamoDB(item);
}

export async function getWorkout(
  userId: string,
  workoutId: string
): Promise<DynamoDBItem<Workout> | null> {
  const tableName = process.env.DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME;

  if (!tableName) {
    throw new Error('DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME environment variable is not set');
  }

  try {
    const command = new GetCommand({
      TableName: tableName,
      Key: {
        pk: `user#${userId}`,
        sk: `workout#${workoutId}`
      }
    });

    const result = await docClient.send(command);

    if (!result.Item) {
      return null;
    }

    return deserializeFromDynamoDB(result.Item) as DynamoDBItem<Workout>;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading workout:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

export async function getRecentWorkouts(
  userId: string,
  limit: number = 10
): Promise<DynamoDBItem<Workout>[]> {
  const tableName = process.env.DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME;

  if (!tableName) {
    throw new Error('DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME environment variable is not set');
  }

  try {
    const command = new QueryCommand({
      TableName: tableName,
      KeyConditionExpression: 'pk = :pk AND begins_with(sk, :sk)',
      ExpressionAttributeValues: {
        ':pk': `user#${userId}`,
        ':sk': 'workout#'
      },
      ScanIndexForward: false, // Most recent first
      Limit: limit
    });

    const result = await docClient.send(command);

    if (!result.Items || result.Items.length === 0) {
      return [];
    }

    return result.Items.map(item =>
      deserializeFromDynamoDB(item) as DynamoDBItem<Workout>
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading recent workouts:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

export async function getWorkoutsByCoach(
  userId: string,
  coachId: string,
  limit: number = 20
): Promise<DynamoDBItem<Workout>[]> {
  // Implementation for coach-specific workouts
  // Will need to filter by coachIds array containing the coachId
  // May require a scan operation or additional GSI structure
}
```

### TypeScript Types

Add to `amplify/functions/libs/coach-creator/types.ts`:

```typescript
export interface Workout {
  workoutId: string;
  userId: string;
  coachIds: string[];
  coachNames: string[];
  conversationId: string;
  completedAt: Date;
  workoutData: UniversalWorkoutSchema;
  extractionMetadata: {
    confidence: number;
    extractedAt: Date;
    reviewedBy?: string;
    reviewedAt?: Date;
  };
}

// Reference to Universal Workout Schema
export interface UniversalWorkoutSchema {
  // This will be defined based on the UNIVERSAL_WORKOUT_SCHEMA.md
  // For now, use a flexible structure
  workout_id: string;
  user_id: string;
  date: string;
  discipline: string;
  methodology?: string;
  workout_name?: string;

---

## Integrated Context System

### Semantic Search Integration
The workout logging system is now fully integrated with the broader coaching context system:

**Three Types of Context:**
1. **Workout Summaries** (`workout_summary`) - Generated after each workout extraction
2. **Coach Creator Sessions** (`coach_creator_summary`) - From coach creation process
3. **Conversation Summaries** (`conversation_summary`) - Generated every 5 messages + complexity triggers

**Unified Retrieval:**
```typescript
const pineconeResult = await queryPineconeContext(userId, userResponse, {
  topK: 6, // Increased from 3 to accommodate multiple context types
  includeWorkouts: true,
  includeCoachCreator: true,
  includeConversationSummaries: true,
  minScore: 0.7
});
```

**Context Injection in System Prompt:**
- `RELEVANT WORKOUT HISTORY:` - Past workout summaries
- `COACH CREATION CONTEXT:` - Coach personality and methodology context
- `COACHING RELATIONSHIP MEMORY:` - Conversation summaries with goals, preferences, emotional state

**Trigger Detection:**
- Extended methodology keywords (5/3/1, westside, rpe, etc.)
- Comprehensive technique keywords (squat, deadlift, form cues, etc.)
- Conversation memory triggers (remember, you said, we discussed, etc.)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Coach Personality Integration
- Workout acknowledgment must match the coach's personality
- Use existing `coachConfig.personality_prompt` in acknowledgment generation
- Include recent workout context in future coach conversations through Pinecone semantic search
- Workout summaries are automatically included in coach context when semantically relevant to user messages

### User Experience Flow
1. User describes workout in coach conversation
2. Coach immediately acknowledges with personality-matched response
3. Coach asks follow-up questions for missing key details
4. Async extraction happens in background
5. Full workout data available in workout history
6. User can edit/review extracted data by clicking on workout
7. **NEW**: Workout summary automatically generated and stored in Pinecone
8. **NEW**: Future coach conversations can reference past workouts through semantic search
9. **NEW**: Coach has contextual memory of user's workout history when relevant

### Future Enhancements
- Multiple coach support (expand coachIds array)
- Prescribed workout comparison
- Coach notifications and analytics
- Workout sharing between coaches
- Advanced workout templates and prescription system

### Implemented Enhancements (Since Original Document)
- **Pinecone Integration**: Workout summaries are automatically generated and stored in Pinecone for semantic search
- **Coach Context**: Workouts provide context to coaches through semantic search when relevant
- **Conversation Memory System**: Parallel implementation for conversation summaries alongside workout summaries
- **Enhanced Detection**: Expanded methodology and technique keywords for better workout and coaching context detection
- **Unified Context System**: Workouts, coach creator sessions, and conversation summaries all contribute to coaching context
