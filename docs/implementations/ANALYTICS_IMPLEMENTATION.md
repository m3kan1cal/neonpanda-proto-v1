## Weekly Analytics Pipeline Architecture

### Phase 1: Trigger & Data Collection (Sunday 6:00 AM UTC) ✅ COMPLETE

```yaml
1. CloudWatch Event Trigger ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Cron expression: "0 6 ? * SUN *" ✅
   - Targets: Lambda function (build-weekly-analytics) ✅
   - Retry policy: 2 retries with exponential backoff ✅

2. Lambda: build-weekly-analytics ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Query all active users from DynamoDB (users table) ✅
   - Process users in batches of 50 for efficiency ✅
   - Direct DynamoDB queries (no SQS overhead) ✅
   - Built-in retry logic for failed processing ✅
   - Skip users with < 2 workouts that week ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **EventBridge Schedule**: `cron(0 6 ? * 1 *)` in `build-weekly-analytics/resource.ts`
- **GSI-3 User Queries**: `queryAllUsers()` using `entityType='user'` with pagination
- **Batch Processing**: 50 users per batch with `exclusiveStartKey` pagination
- **Error Handling**: Per-user and global try/catch with detailed logging
- **Memory**: 1024MB, 15min timeout for processing all users
- **Workout Filtering**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Users with < 2 workouts are skipped in `batch-processing.ts` line 44-49

### Phase 2: Data Aggregation (Per User) ✅ COMPLETE

```yaml
4. Fetch Current Week Data ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Query DynamoDB (workouts table) ✅
   - Filter: user_id AND date BETWEEN week_start AND week_end ✅
   - Get all workouts in UWS format (already extracted) ✅
   - Include: completed workouts, skipped workouts, modifications ✅

5. Fetch Historical Context ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Previous 4 weeks of workout summaries (for trending) ✅
   - Query pattern: user_id AND date BETWEEN (week_start - 28) AND week_end ✅
   - Extract existing AI-generated summaries (no aggregation needed) ✅

6. Fetch Coaching Context ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Query DynamoDB (conversations table) ✅
   - Get last 2 weeks of coach-athlete messages ✅
   - Extract: technical cues, feedback, goals discussed ✅
   - Summarize using Claude Haiku (fast/cheap) if > 1000 words ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

7. Fetch User Context ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Query DynamoDB (user_memories table) ✅
   - Get: injuries, goals, PRs, equipment access, schedule constraints ✅
   - Include: athlete profile (training age, competition dates) ✅
   - Recent check-ins or subjective feedback ✅

8. Fetch Program Context ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (intentionally skipped)
   - Query DynamoDB (programs table) ❌
   - Get current program template/methodology ❌
   - Include: phase, week number, intended stimulus ❌
   - Planned vs completed for adherence metrics ❌
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Data Fetching Library**: `amplify/functions/libs/analytics/data-fetching.ts`
- **Week Calculations**: `getCurrentWeekRange()`, `getLastNWeeksRange()` for date filtering
- **Parallel Data Fetching**: All user data (workouts, conversations, memories) fetched simultaneously
- **Query → Detail Pattern**: Use simplified list queries then fetch full details for each item
- **Message Filtering**: Coaching conversations filtered to last 2 weeks of messages only
- **Error Isolation**: Individual data fetch failures don't stop overall user processing
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed metrics for workouts, conversations, memories, and historical summaries per user
- **Early Filtering**: Users with < 2 workouts skipped before expensive data aggregation
- **Historical Summaries**: Leverages existing AI-generated workout summaries (4 weeks, ~8KB vs 56KB raw data)
- **Summary Quality Filter**: Only includes historical workouts with substantial summaries (>50 characters)

### Phase 3: LLM Analytics Processing ✅ COMPLETE

```yaml
9. Construct Analytics Prompt ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Combine all context into structured prompt ✅
   - Format:
     * Athlete context (AI profile + memories) ✅
     * Current week UWS data ✅
     * Previous weeks summary ✅
     * Coaching conversations summary ✅
     * Program context ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED (intentionally skipped)
   - Add system prompt with output format requirements ✅

10. Call Claude via Bedrock ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 (Sonnet 3.5 with thinking) ✅
   - Max tokens: Default Bedrock limits ✅
   - Temperature: Default (for consistency) ✅
   - Retry logic: Basic error handling with log and continue ✅
   - Fallback: Log error and continue processing other users ✅

11. Process LLM Response ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Parse JSON response ✅
   - Validate structure against schema (basic JSON parsing) ✅
   - Handle any parsing errors gracefully ✅
   - Log complete analytics output for prototype ✅
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Analytics Generation**: `generateAnalytics()` function in `data-fetching.ts`
- **Enhanced Athlete Context**: Combines AI-generated athlete profile with structured user memories
- **Comprehensive Prompt**: Enhanced with athlete context, coaching conversations, historical summaries
- **Claude Thinking Enabled**: Uses same thinking pattern as workout extraction/normalization
- **Error Isolation**: Analytics failures don't stop batch processing
- **Prototype Logging**: Complete JSON analytics output logged for review
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into `processBatch()` workflow

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Batch Processing**: Process users in batches to reduce Lambda cold starts
2. **Caching**: Cache previous weeks' summaries to avoid reprocessing
3. **Single Model Processing**: Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for all analytics generation (Haiku summarization not implemented)
4. **Smart Querying**: Use DynamoDB query instead of scan, proper indexes
5. **Conditional Analytics**: Skip if user had < 2 workouts that week

### Scaling Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Limit concurrent Bedrock calls to avoid throttling
- **Queue Management**: Use SQS batch processing for efficiency
- **Regional Deployment**: Process users in their regional Bedrock endpoint
- **Progressive Rollout**: Start with power users, expand gradually
