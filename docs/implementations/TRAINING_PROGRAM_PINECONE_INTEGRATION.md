# Training Program Pinecone Integration - Complete

## Overview
Added Pinecone semantic search integration for training programs, following the **exact same pattern** as workout Pinecone integration.

---

## Files Created

### 1. **Summary Generation**: `amplify/functions/libs/training-program/summary.ts` (96 lines)

**Purpose**: AI-powered summary generation for training programs

**Function**: `generateTrainingProgramSummary()`
```typescript
export const generateTrainingProgramSummary = async (
  program: TrainingProgram,
  conversationMessages: any[]
): Promise<string>
```

**What It Does**:
- Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 to generate 3-4 sentence summary
- Includes: program name, goals, structure, phases, progression strategy
- Extracts context from original Build mode conversation
- Fallback to basic summary if AI fails

**Summary Content**:
1. Program name and primary training goals
2. Structure overview (duration, phases, frequency)
3. Key focus areas and progression strategy
4. Important conversation context (user needs, constraints, preferences)

**Example Output**:
> "12-Week Strength Builder: 4x/week program targeting squat, deadlift, and bench press improvements. Structured in 3 phases: Foundation (4 weeks), Intensification (6 weeks), Peak (2 weeks). User focused on hitting a 405lb squat by competition in March."

---

### 2. **Pinecone Storage**: `amplify/functions/libs/training-program/pinecone.ts` (167 lines)

**Purpose**: Store/delete program summaries in Pinecone for semantic search

**Functions**:
- `storeTrainingProgramSummaryInPinecone()` - Store program summary
- `deleteTrainingProgramSummaryFromPinecone()` - Delete when program deleted

**Metadata Stored**:

**Base Metadata**:
```typescript
{
  recordType: 'training_program_summary',
  programId: string,
  programName: string,
  status: 'active' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'archived',
  coachId: string,
  conversationId: string,
  startDate: string,
  endDate: string,
  totalDays: number,
  currentDay: number,
  trainingFrequency: number,
  totalWorkouts: number,
  completedWorkouts: number,
  adherenceRate: number,
  phaseCount: number,
  topics: string[], // ['training_program', 'program_structure', 'active', ...goals]
  createdAt: string
}
```

**Phase Metadata**:
```typescript
{
  phases: Array<{ name, durationDays, focusAreas }>,
  phaseNames: string[],
  allFocusAreas: string[] // Unique focus areas across all phases
}
```

**Context Metadata**:
```typescript
{
  trainingGoals: string[],
  equipmentConstraints: string[],
  hasEquipmentConstraints: boolean
}
```

**Optional Metadata**:
```typescript
{
  lastActivityDate?: string,
  pausedAt?: string,
  pausedDuration?: number
}
```

---

### 3. **Handler Update**: `amplify/functions/build-training-program/handler.ts`

**Added After Program Generation**:
```typescript
// Generate AI summary for coach context
console.info("Generating training program summary...");
const summary = await generateTrainingProgramSummary(
  program,
  event.conversationMessages
);

// Store program summary in Pinecone
console.info("üìù Storing program summary in Pinecone...");
const pineconeResult = await storeTrainingProgramSummaryInPinecone(
  event.userId,
  summary,
  program
);
```

**Updated Response** (includes Pinecone result):
```typescript
return createOkResponse({
  success: true,
  programId,
  programName: program.name,
  // ... other fields
  summary, // NEW: AI-generated summary
  pineconeStored: pineconeResult.success, // NEW
  pineconeRecordId: pineconeResult.recordId, // NEW
});
```

## Pattern Alignment with Workouts

| Component | Workout Implementation | Training Program Implementation | Match? |
|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------|
| **Summary Function** | `generateWorkoutSummary()` | `generateTrainingProgramSummary()` | ‚úÖ |
| **Summary Input** | (workoutData, originalMessage) | (program, conversationMessages) | ‚úÖ Domain-specific |
| **Summary Length** | 2-3 sentences | 3-4 sentences | ‚úÖ Appropriate |
| **AI Model** | Claude Sonnet (default) | Claude Sonnet (default) | ‚úÖ |
| **Fallback** | Basic string if AI fails | Basic string if AI fails | ‚úÖ |
| **Storage Function** | `storeWorkoutSummaryInPinecone()` | `storeTrainingProgramSummaryInPinecone()` | ‚úÖ |
| **Delete Function** | `deleteWorkoutSummaryFromPinecone()` | `deleteTrainingProgramSummaryFromPinecone()` | ‚úÖ |
| **Metadata Structure** | Base + optional + discipline-specific | Base + optional + phase + context | ‚úÖ Domain-specific |
| **Record Type** | `workout_summary` | `training_program_summary` | ‚úÖ |
| **Topics** | Performance, discipline, type | Structure, status, goals | ‚úÖ Domain-specific |
| **Error Handling** | Non-critical, warn and continue | Non-critical, warn and continue | ‚úÖ |
| **Centralized Helper** | `storePineconeContext()` | `storePineconeContext()` | ‚úÖ |

## Complete Flow Comparison

### Workout Flow:
```
1. Extract workout with AI
2. Normalize workout
3. Generate AI summary ‚Üê Pinecone content
4. Save to DynamoDB
5. Store summary in Pinecone ‚Üê Semantic search
6. Return success
```

### Training Program Flow:
```
1. Extract program structure with AI
2. Normalize program
3. Generate workout templates per phase
4. Store detailed program in S3
5. Save to DynamoDB
6. Generate AI summary ‚Üê Pinecone content
7. Store summary in Pinecone ‚Üê Semantic search
8. Return success
```

**Both flows now include Pinecone storage!** ‚úÖ

## Use Cases Enabled

### 1. **Semantic Search in Conversations**
User: "What program am I on?"
‚Üí Pinecone finds active program via semantic search
‚Üí Coach responds with current program details

### 2. **Program Progress Context**
User: "How's my progress?"
‚Üí Pinecone retrieves program with adherence metrics
‚Üí Coach provides context-aware feedback

### 3. **Historical Reference**
User: "What was that strength program I did last year?"
‚Üí Pinecone searches past programs
‚Üí Coach references specific program structure

### 4. **Training Continuity**
User: "I want to do another hypertrophy program"
‚Üí Pinecone finds previous hypertrophy programs
‚Üí Coach can build on past successful approaches

---

## Metadata Queryable Fields

Programs can now be found by:
- **Program name** (semantic: "strength builder", "hypertrophy")
- **Status** (active, paused, completed, archived)
- **Training goals** (stored as topics)
- **Phase names** (searchable context)
- **Focus areas** (aggregated across all phases)
- **Equipment** (constraints stored as metadata)
- **Date range** (startDate, endDate)
- **Progress** (currentDay, totalDays, adherenceRate)

---

## Error Handling

**Non-Critical Failures** (same as workouts):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If summary generation fails ‚Üí Use fallback summary
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If Pinecone storage fails ‚Üí Log warning, continue
- ‚úÖ Program generation completes successfully regardless
- üìù All errors logged for debugging

**Why Non-Critical**:
- Pinecone is for future semantic search
- Not required for immediate program functionality
- DynamoDB is source of truth
- User experience not impacted by Pinecone failures
