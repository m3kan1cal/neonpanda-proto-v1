## Phase 2 Requirements vs. Implementation

### From TRAINING_PROGRAM_V1_OUTLINE.md

#### ‚úÖ Conversation Mode System: Chat vs. Build (Lines 595-721)

**Required:**
- Mode toggle interface (üí¨ Chat and üèóÔ∏è Build)
- Mode parameter in requests
- Prompt branching based on mode
- Shared context and conversation history
- Seamless transitions

**Implemented:**
1. ‚úÖ **`ConversationMode` type** (`libs/coach-conversation/types.ts:36`)
   ```typescript
   export type ConversationMode = 'chat' | 'build';
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **`CONVERSATION_MODES` constants** (`libs/coach-conversation/types.ts:42-45`)
   ```typescript
   export const CONVERSATION_MODES = {
     CHAT: 'chat' as const,
     BUILD: 'build' as const,
   } satisfies Record<string, ConversationMode>;
   ```

3. ‚úÖ **Mode in conversation entity** (`libs/coach-conversation/types.ts:55`)
   ```typescript
   export interface CoachConversation {
     mode: ConversationMode; // Determines behavior and prompts
   }
   ```

4. ‚úÖ **Mode parameter in create-coach-conversation** (`create-coach-conversation/handler.ts:31-32`)
   ```typescript
   const conversationMode = mode === CONVERSATION_MODES.BUILD
     ? CONVERSATION_MODES.BUILD
     : CONVERSATION_MODES.CHAT;
   ```

5. ‚úÖ **Build mode tagging** (`create-coach-conversation/handler.ts:49`)
   ```typescript
   tags: conversationMode === CONVERSATION_MODES.BUILD ? ['program_creation'] : []
   ```

6. ‚úÖ **Build mode prompt** (`libs/coach-conversation/prompt-generation.ts:65-177`)
   - Complete Build mode system prompt with enhanced program creation guidance
   - **Required information checklist** (goals, timeline, equipment, frequency)
   - **4-phase conversation flow guidance** (Discovery ‚Üí Constraints ‚Üí Structure ‚Üí Confirmation)
   - **Validation before generation** (verify all essentials are collected)
   - Clear instructions for program structure generation
   - Trigger mechanism: `**[GENERATE_PROGRAM]**`
   - Semi-structured approach: flexible conversation with clear requirements

7. ‚úÖ **Mode detection in streaming handler** (`stream-coach-conversation/handler.ts:809-864`)
   ```typescript
   if (conversationMode === CONVERSATION_MODES.BUILD) {
     const generationDetection = detectAndPrepareForTrainingProgramGeneration(fullAiResponse);
     if (generationDetection.shouldGenerate) {
       // Generate program
     }
   }
   ```

#### ‚úÖ AI Program Generation (Lines 298-322)

**Required:**

- Daily workouts following universal workout schema

**Implemented:**

1. ‚úÖ **Program generation orchestrator** (`libs/training-program/program-generator.ts:227-440`)
   - `generateTrainingProgramFromConversation()` - Main orchestration function
   - Fetches coach config, user profile, Pinecone context
   - Extracts program structure
   - Generates phase workouts
   - Stores in DynamoDB + S3

2. ‚úÖ **Coach personality integration** (`program-generator.ts:240-283`)
   ```typescript
   const [coachConfig, userProfile] = await Promise.all([
     getCoachConfig(userId, coachId),
     getUserProfile(userId),
   ]);

   const pineconeResults = await queryPineconeContext(userId, conversationSummary, {
     topK: 10,
     includeWorkouts: true,
     includeConversationSummaries: true,
     includeCoachCreator: true,
     includeMethodology: true,
   });
   ```

3. ‚úÖ **Structure extraction with personality** (`program-generator.ts:42-126`)
   - Uses `buildCoachPersonalityPrompt()` for consistency
   - Incorporates Pinecone context (memories, workouts, methodology)
   - Includes critical training directive from user profile
   - Analyzes conversation for goals, equipment, timeline

4. ‚úÖ **Daily workout generation with personality** (`program-generator.ts:128-221`)
   - `generatePhaseWorkouts()` - Generates templates for each phase
   - Uses coach personality prompt with motivation
   - Considers Pinecone context for injuries, preferences
   - Respects phase goals and progression

5. ‚úÖ **Robust JSON parsing** (`program-generator.ts:110, 201`)
   - Uses `parseJsonWithFallbacks()` instead of raw `JSON.parse()`
   - Handles malformed AI responses gracefully

6. ‚úÖ **S3 storage integration** (`program-generator.ts:359-374`)
   ```typescript
   await storeTrainingProgramDetailsInS3(
     userId,
     programId,
     dailyWorkoutTemplates,
     {}, // Empty program context for now
     generationMetadata
   );
   ```

#### ‚úÖ Streaming Response with Contextual Events

   ```typescript
   yield formatContextualEvent(
     'üéØ **Generating your training program...**',
     'training_program_generation_start'
   );
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Generation complete event** (`handler.ts:840-848`)
   ```typescript
   const successMessage = `‚úÖ **Training Program Created!**\n` +
     `**${generatedTrainingProgram.program.name}**\n` +
     `Duration: ${generatedTrainingProgram.program.totalDays} days\n` +
     `Phases: ${generatedTrainingProgram.program.phases.length}\n`;

   yield formatContextualEvent(successMessage, 'training_program_generation_complete');
   ```

3. ‚úÖ **Error handling** (`handler.ts:853-862`)
   ```typescript
   yield formatContextualEvent(errorMessage, 'training_program_generation_error');
   ```

4. ‚úÖ **Program ID in message metadata** (`handler.ts:874`)
   ```typescript
   metadata: {
     model: MODEL_IDS.CLAUDE_SONNET_4_DISPLAY,
     ...(generatedTrainingProgram && { generatedProgramId: generatedTrainingProgram.programId }),
   }
   ```

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **No program modification** - Once generated, programs are fixed (Phase 3)
2. **No workout regeneration** - Users can't ask to modify specific workouts (Phase 3)
3. **No frontend UI** - Backend-only implementation (Phase 4)
4. **No adaptation intelligence** - Programs don't adapt based on performance (Post-MVP)

### Future Enhancements (Phase 3+)
1. **Workout regeneration** - "Make tomorrow's workout 30 minutes instead of 60"
2. **Program modification** - "Add more Olympic lifting to Phase 2"
3. **Real-time adaptation** - Adjust based on user feedback, scaling patterns
4. **Program templates** - Coaches can create reusable program templates
5. **Multi-coach programs** - Collaborate between multiple coaches
