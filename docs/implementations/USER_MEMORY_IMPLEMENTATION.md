# User Memory Feature Implementation Log
**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Developer**: Assistant + User Collaboration

## Implementation Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive user memory system that allows AI coaches to persistently remember user preferences, goals, constraints, and instructions across coaching sessions. The feature uses natural language detection to automatically capture and store user-requested memories, then integrates them seamlessly into future coaching conversations.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Detection Strategy
**Decision**: Use Amazon Bedrock Nova Micro for memory request detection
**Rationale**:
- Cost-optimized model perfect for classification tasks
- Faster response times compared to larger models
- Conservative 70% confidence threshold prevents false positives
- Natural language prompting provides better results than regex patterns

### 2. Storage Pattern
**Decision**: Follow existing DynamoDB patterns with `user#${userId}` + `userMemory#${memoryId}`
**Rationale**:
- Consistency with existing coach configs, workouts, conversations
- Efficient user-scoped queries
- No GSI complexity needed for initial implementation
- Aligns with established access patterns

### 3. Integration Timing
**Decision**: Detect memories AFTER AI response generation
**Rationale**:
- AI responds naturally without knowing about memory storage
- Memory confirmation feels more natural when appended
- Prevents memory detection from influencing AI response content
- Better user experience flow

### 4. Memory Types Classification
**Decision**: AI-driven classification into 5 types (preference, goal, constraint, instruction, context)
**Rationale**:
- Provides organization for prompt generation
- Helps AI understand how to use different memory types
- Enables future filtering and analytics capabilities
- User doesn't need to think about categorization

## Implementation Components

### 1. Type System
**File**: `amplify/functions/libs/coach-conversation/types.ts`

```typescript
interface UserMemory {
  memoryId: string;
  userId: string;
  coachId?: string;
  content: string;
  memoryType: 'preference' | 'goal' | 'constraint' | 'instruction' | 'context';
  metadata: {
    createdAt: Date;
    lastUsed?: Date;
    usageCount: number;
    source: 'conversation' | 'explicit_request';
    importance: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
    tags?: string[];
  };
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Optional coach scoping for coach-specific vs global memories
- Rich metadata for usage tracking and prioritization
- Extensible type system for future enhancements
- Consistent with existing type patterns

### 2. Detection Engine
**File**: `amplify/functions/libs/coach-conversation/detection.ts`

**Functions Implemented**:
- `detectUserMemoryRequest(event: UserMemoryDetectionEvent): Promise<UserMemoryDetectionResult>`
- `createUserMemory(detectionResult: UserMemoryDetectionResult, userId: string, coachId?: string): UserMemory | null`

**Detection Features**:
- Context-aware analysis using last 3 conversation messages
- Comprehensive prompt with clear memory request indicators
- JSON response validation and error handling
- Conservative confidence thresholding (70%)
- Proper memory type and importance classification

**Detection Prompt Strategy**:
```
MEMORY REQUEST INDICATORS:
- "I want you to remember..."
- "Please remember that..."
- "Remember this about me..."
- "Don't forget that I..."
- "Keep in mind that..."
- "Note that I..."
- "For future reference..."
- "Always remember..."
```

### 3. Storage Operations
**File**: `amplify/dynamodb/operations.ts`

**Functions Implemented**:
- `saveUserMemory(memory: UserMemory): Promise<void>`
- `queryUserMemories(userId: string, coachId?: string, options?): Promise<UserMemory[]>`
- `updateUserMemory(memoryId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>`

**Storage Features**:
- Consistent pk/sk pattern: `user#${userId}` + `userMemory#${memoryId}`
- Filtering by memory type, importance, coach scope
- Sorting by importance (high>medium>low), usage count, creation date
- Background usage tracking with non-blocking updates
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 4. Prompt Integration
**File**: `amplify/functions/libs/coach-conversation/prompt-generation.ts`

**Function**: `generateUserMemoriesSection(userMemories: UserMemory[]): string`

**Integration Features**:
- Strategic placement in Section 5.5 (between detailed background and user context)
- Memories grouped by type for better organization
- Rich metadata display (importance, usage statistics, creation date)
- Clear AI instructions for natural memory usage
- Graceful handling of empty memory sets

**Prompt Format**:
```
# USER MEMORIES
Based on previous conversations, here are important things the user has specifically asked you to remember:

## Preference Memories
### 1. I prefer morning workouts and like compound movements
- **Importance**: high
- **Usage**: Used 3 times (last: Jan 12, 2025)
- **Created**: Jan 10, 2025

**IMPORTANT**: Use these memories to personalize your coaching...
```

### 5. Modular Service Architecture (Post-Refactoring)
**Primary Handler**: `amplify/functions/send-coach-conversation-message/handler.ts` (reduced from 630 to 228 lines)

**Extracted Service Modules**:
- **`context.ts`**: Gathers conversation context (workouts + Pinecone semantic search)
- **`workout-detection.ts`**: Handles workout detection and async processing
- **`memory-processing.ts`**: Split into two focused functions:
  - `queryUserMemories()`: Retrieves existing memories for AI context (BEFORE response)
  - `detectAndSaveMemories()`: Detects and saves new memories (AFTER response)
- **`response-generation.ts`**: AI response generation with all contextual data

**Integration Flow**:
1. `gatherConversationContext()` - Load workouts + Pinecone context
2. `detectAndProcessWorkout()` - Handle workout detection/extraction
3. `queryUserMemories()` - Retrieve existing memories for context (limit: 10)
4. `generateAIResponse()` - Generate response with full memory context
5. `detectAndSaveMemories()` - Detect memory requests in user message (post-response)
6. Save new memories if detected with >70% confidence
7. Append memory confirmation to AI response

**Benefits of Modularization**:
- **64% code reduction** in main handler (630 → 228 lines)
- **Single responsibility** per service module
- **Easier testing** and debugging of individual components
- **Maintained execution order** and functionality
- **Cleaner imports** and reduced complexity

**Error Handling**:
- Memory operations never interrupt conversation flow
- Graceful degradation when memory systems unavailable
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
- Background operations use proper error catching

## Code Quality Improvements

## Database Schema Updates

### New Entity Type: userMemory
```json
{
  "pk": "user#${userId}",
  "sk": "userMemory#${memoryId}",
  "entityType": "userMemory",
  "createdAt": "ISO timestamp",
  "updatedAt": "ISO timestamp",
  "attributes": {
    "memoryId": "user_memory_${timestamp}_${random}",
    "userId": "string",
    "coachId": "string (optional)",
    "content": "string",
    "memoryType": "preference|goal|constraint|instruction|context",
    "metadata": {
      "createdAt": "Date",
      "lastUsed": "Date (optional)",
      "usageCount": "number",
      "source": "explicit_request",
      "importance": "high|medium|low",
      "tags": "string[] (optional)"
    }
  }
}
```

### Query Patterns
```javascript
// Get all memories for user
Query: pk="user#${userId}" AND sk begins_with "userMemory#"

// Get memories with filtering
Query: pk="user#${userId}" AND sk begins_with "userMemory#"
FilterExpression: coachId = "${coachId}" AND importance = "high"

// Get specific memory
Query: pk="user#${userId}" AND sk="userMemory#${memoryId}"
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Timing is Critical
Initially placed memory detection before AI response generation, which created an unnatural UX. Moving detection to post-response significantly improved the user experience.

### 2. Conservative Thresholds Work Better
Started with 60% confidence threshold but had too many false positives. 70% threshold provides much better precision while maintaining good recall.

### 3. Background Operations Improve Performance
Non-blocking usage statistics updates prevent conversation slowdowns while still maintaining useful analytics.

### 4. Natural Language Detection > Regex
AI-driven detection significantly outperforms regex patterns for natural language memory requests with better handling of variations and context.

### 5. Consistent Patterns Ease Development
Following existing DynamoDB and type patterns made implementation much faster and reduces cognitive load for future developers.
