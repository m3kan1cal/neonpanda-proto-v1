## Philosophy & Design Principles

### Core Design Philosophy

This schema is built around the principle that **fitness data should be captured through natural conversation**, then intelligently extracted into structured formats that enable sophisticated analytics, progress tracking, and AI coaching. The design balances three critical requirements:

1. **Universal Consistency**: Core fields work across all fitness disciplines
2. **Discipline Flexibility**: Specialized tracking for methodology-specific needs
3. **AI-First Architecture**: Optimized for natural language extraction and processing

### Key Design Principles

#### 1. **Conversation-Centric Data Collection**
- Users describe workouts naturally: *"I did Fran in 8:57 with 95lb thrusters"*
- AI extracts structured data while preserving conversational context
- No forced form-filling or rigid input requirements

#### 2. **Layered Information Architecture**
```
Universal Core (all workouts)
├── Performance Metrics (cross-discipline)
├── Discipline-Specific Data (methodology-aware)
└── Analytics Metadata (extraction quality, confidence)
```

#### 3. **Analytics-Driven Structure**
- Every field designed to support trend analysis and progress tracking
- Time-series optimization for performance prediction
- Cross-training analysis capabilities built-in

#### 4. **Extensible by Design**
- New disciplines can be added without breaking existing data
- Methodology-specific extensions encouraged
- Forward-compatible versioning system

#### 5. **Safety Integration**
- Rich data supports sophisticated safety validation
- Injury tracking and prevention capabilities
- Overtraining detection through multiple data points

## AI Extraction Guidelines

### Core Extraction Principles

#### 1. **Context-Aware Processing**
AI should consider user's discipline, experience level, and historical patterns when interpreting workout descriptions.

```python
def extract_workout_data(user_input, user_context):
    # Consider user's primary discipline
    discipline = infer_discipline(user_input, user_context.primary_disciplines)

    # Adjust extraction based on user experience
    extraction_depth = determine_depth(user_context.experience_level)

    # Apply discipline-specific extraction patterns
    structured_data = apply_discipline_extraction(user_input, discipline)

    return structured_data
```

#### 2. **Progressive Enhancement**
Start with basic extraction and enhance with follow-up questions:

```
Initial: "I did Fran today"
Basic Extraction: {workout_name: "Fran", discipline: "crossfit"}

Follow-up: "What was your time?"
Enhanced: {workout_name: "Fran", total_time: 537}

Follow-up: "What weight did you use for thrusters?"
Complete: {workout_name: "Fran", total_time: 537, thruster_weight: 95}
```

#### 3. **Confidence Scoring**
Assign confidence levels to extracted data:

- **High Confidence (0.9+)**: Explicit numbers, clear terminology
- **Medium Confidence (0.7-0.9)**: Inferred from context, typical patterns
- **Low Confidence (0.5-0.7)**: Ambiguous language, requires verification

### Language Pattern Recognition

#### Time Expressions
**CRITICAL: All time values MUST be stored in seconds**
```
"took me 8 minutes and 57 seconds" → total_time: 537
"finished in under 9 minutes" → total_time: <540, confidence: 0.7
"around 8 and a half minutes" → total_time: 510, confidence: 0.8
"45 minute workout" → duration: 2700
"1 hour 15 minute session" → duration: 4500
"my usual Fran time" → requires historical lookup
```

#### Weight Expressions
```
"used 95 pound thrusters" → weight: {value: 95, unit: "lbs"}
"went heavier than usual" → requires historical comparison
"RX weight" → lookup standard weights for exercise
"about 85% of my max" → percentage_1rm: 85
```

#### Rep and Set Patterns
```
"broke the 21 into 10, 6, and 5" → broken_sets: [10, 6, 5]
"did 5 sets of 8" → 5 sets, 8 reps each
"went to failure on the last set" → failure_achieved: true
"had 3 reps left in the tank" → rpe: ~7
"max pull-ups - got 15" → prescribed: "max", completed: 15
"to failure" → prescribed: "max", completed: [actual number achieved]
"AMRAP strict pull-ups" → prescribed: "max", completed: [actual reps]
```

#### Workout Score Patterns
```
"Fran in 8:57" → score: {value: 537, type: "time", unit: "seconds"}
"finished in 12 minutes 34 seconds" → score: {value: 754, type: "time", unit: "seconds"}
"got 12 rounds" → score: {value: 12, type: "rounds"}
"12 rounds plus 5 reps" → score: {value: "12+5", type: "rounds"}
"completed 347 total reps" → score: {value: 347, type: "reps"}
"max deadlift was 315 pounds" → score: {value: 315, type: "weight", unit: "lbs"}
"ran 5.2 miles total" → score: {value: 5.2, type: "distance", unit: "miles"}
```

#### Subjective Quality Indicators
```
"form felt really good" → form_quality: 8
"struggled with technique" → form_quality: 4
"absolutely crushed it" → overall_performance: 9
"feeling sore already" → immediate_fatigue: high
```

#### Comparative Statements
```
"faster than last time" → requires_previous_workout_lookup: true
"new PR" → pr_achievement: true
"worst Fran time ever" → performance_context: "poor"
"back to my normal pace" → performance_context: "typical"
```

### Discipline-Specific Extraction Patterns

#### CrossFit Terminology
```
"did it RX" → rx_status: "rx"
"scaled the weight" → rx_status: "scaled"
"time capped" → completed: false, reason: "time_cap"
"got no-repped" → form_issue: true
"kipping pull-ups" → variation: "kipping"
"strict handstand push-ups" → variation: "strict"
```

#### Powerlifting Terminology
```
"hit my opener" → attempt_type: "opener", successful: true
"missed my third" → attempt_type: "third_attempt", successful: false
"felt like RPE 8" → rpe: 8
"85% for a triple" → percentage_1rm: 85, reps: 3
"raw squat" → equipment: "raw"
"with wraps" → equipment: ["wraps"]
```

#### Bodybuilding Terminology
```
"chest day" → muscle_groups_primary: ["chest"]
"did a drop set" → intensity_techniques: "drop_set"
"went to failure" → failure_achieved: true
"really felt the pump" → pump_rating: 8+
"mind-muscle connection was on point" → mind_muscle_connection: 8+
```

#### Running Terminology
```
"tempo run" → run_type: "tempo"
"negative split" → pacing_strategy: "negative_split"
"felt easy" → effort_level: "easy"
"around 7-minute pace" → pace: "7:00"
"uphill the whole way" → terrain: "uphill"
```

### Error Handling and Validation

#### Common Extraction Errors
1. **Unit Confusion**: "95 kilos" vs "95 pounds"
2. **Time Format Ambiguity**: "8:57" could be 8m57s or 8h57m
3. **Exercise Name Variations**: "thrusters" vs "front squat to press"
4. **Scaling Context**: "light weight" without reference point

#### Validation Strategies
```python
def validate_extraction(extracted_data, user_context):
    errors = []

    # Sanity check times
    if extracted_data.get('total_time', 0) > 7200:  # >2 hours
        errors.append("duration_too_long")

    # Validate weights against user history
    if extracted_data.get('weight', 0) > user_context.max_recorded_weight * 1.5:
        errors.append("weight_unusually_high")

    # Check for required fields by discipline
    required_fields = get_required_fields(extracted_data['discipline'])
    missing_fields = [f for f in required_fields if f not in extracted_data]

    return errors, missing_fields
```

### Follow-Up Question Generation

AI should generate intelligent follow-up questions to complete extraction:

#### Based on Missing Data
```python
def generate_follow_ups(extracted_data, confidence_scores):
    questions = []

    if 'total_time' not in extracted_data and extracted_data['discipline'] == 'crossfit':
        questions.append("What was your time for that workout?")

    if confidence_scores.get('weight', 0) < 0.7:
        questions.append("What weight did you use for [exercise]?")

    if 'form_quality' not in extracted_data:
        questions.append("How did your form feel today?")

    return questions
```

#### Based on Inconsistencies
```
If time seems unusually fast: "That's a great time! Is that a new PR for you?"
If weight seems high: "That's heavy! How did the movement feel?"
If workout seems incomplete: "Did you finish all the rounds?"
```

### Extraction Workflow

#### Step 1: Initial Analysis
```python
def initial_extraction(user_input, user_context):
    # Identify discipline and workout type
    discipline = infer_discipline(user_input, user_context)
    workout_type = classify_workout_type(user_input, discipline)

    # Extract universal fields
    universal_data = extract_universal_fields(user_input)

    # Apply discipline-specific extraction
    specific_data = extract_discipline_specific(user_input, discipline)

    return merge_extraction_data(universal_data, specific_data)
```

#### Step 2: Confidence Assessment
```python
def assess_confidence(extracted_data, user_input):
    confidence_scores = {}

    for field, value in extracted_data.items():
        confidence = calculate_field_confidence(field, value, user_input)
        confidence_scores[field] = confidence

    return confidence_scores
```

#### Step 3: Validation and Enhancement
```python
def validate_and_enhance(extracted_data, confidence_scores, user_context):
    # Validate against user history and common sense
    errors = validate_extraction(extracted_data, user_context)

    # Generate follow-up questions for low confidence fields
    follow_ups = generate_follow_ups(extracted_data, confidence_scores)

    # Enhance with historical context where appropriate
    enhanced_data = enhance_with_history(extracted_data, user_context)

    return enhanced_data, follow_ups, errors
```
