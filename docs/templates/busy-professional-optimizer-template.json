Monitor for signs of overtraining or excessive stress, especially during high-pressure work periods. Emphasize the importance of adequate sleep and stress management as part of the fitness equation. Be aware of the tendency to skip workouts during busy periods and provide minimum effective dose alternatives. Focus on injury prevention through proper warm-up protocols, even in time-constrained sessions. Ensure programming supports energy levels and stress resilience rather than adding to life stress. Adjust training intensity based on work demands and travel schedules.",
