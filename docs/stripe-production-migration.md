## Quick Checklist

Use this condensed checklist as you work through the migration:

### Before You Start

- [ ] Complete Stripe business verification
- [ ] Wait for Stripe approval
- [ ] Ensure production environment is stable

### In Stripe Dashboard (Live Mode)

- [ ] Create "EarlyPanda" product ($0/month) → Get `price_xxxxx`
- [ ] Create "ElectricPanda" product ($20/month) → Get `price_xxxxx`
- [ ] Create Payment Link for ElectricPanda → Get `https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxx`
  - Set redirect: `https://neonpanda.ai/welcome?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
- [ ] Get Secret Key from API Keys → Get `sk_live_xxxxx`
- [ ] Create Webhook endpoint: `https://api-prod.neonpanda.ai/stripe/webhook`

- [ ] Add the same variables as above
- [ ] Never commit this file to version control

---

## Phase 3: Code Verification

### Step 3.1: Verify Backend Configuration

No code changes needed, but verify these files are correct:

- [ ] Review `amplify/backend.ts` (lines 905-928)
  - Confirms environment variables are passed to Lambda functions
- [ ] Review `amplify/functions/process-stripe-webhook/handler.ts`
  - Confirms Stripe SDK initialization uses `process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- [ ] Review `amplify/functions/create-stripe-portal-session/handler.ts`
  - Confirms Stripe SDK initialization uses `process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- [ ] Review `amplify/functions/libs/subscription/stripe-helpers.ts`
  - Confirms price ID mapping uses environment variables

### Step 3.2: Verify Frontend Configuration

No code changes needed, but verify:

- [ ] Review `src/utils/apis/subscriptionApi.js` (line 74)
  - Confirms payment link uses `import.meta.env.VITE_ELECTRIC_PANDA_PAYMENT_LINK`

- [ ] Select production branch
- [ ] Click **Environment variables**
- [ ] Replace production Stripe keys with test keys:
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` → test key (sk*test*...)
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` → test webhook secret
  - `ELECTRICPANDA_PRICE_ID` → test price ID
  - `EARLYPANDA_PRICE_ID` → test price ID
  - `VITE_ELECTRIC_PANDA_PAYMENT_LINK` → test payment link
- [ ] Save and redeploy
- [ ] In Stripe Dashboard, pause live webhook endpoint (don't delete)
- [ ] Communicate issue to any affected users

---

## Security Guidelines

### Security Checklist

- [ ] All production Stripe keys stored in AWS Amplify Console only
- [ ] No Stripe secret keys committed to git repository
- [ ] `.env.local` and `.env.local.prod` in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Webhook endpoint uses HTTPS only
- [ ] Webhook signature verification enabled (already in code)
- [ ] Production webhook secret different from test
- [ ] API Gateway logs redact sensitive headers
- [ ] CloudWatch logs don't expose secret keys

### Safe to Commit (Public/Non-Sensitive)

These values can be stored in `NOTES_MLF.md` or documentation:

- ✅ Publishable keys (pk_live_xxxxx)
- ✅ Product IDs (prod_xxxxx)
- ✅ Price IDs (price_xxxxx)
- ✅ Payment Link URLs (https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxx)
- ✅ Webhook endpoint URLs

### NEVER Commit (Secret/Sensitive)

These values must ONLY be stored in AWS Amplify Console:

- ❌ Secret keys (sk_live_xxxxx)
- ❌ Webhook signing secrets (whsec_xxxxx)
- ❌ Any credentials or tokens

### Secure Storage Options

#### For Temporary Storage During Migration

Use a password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden):

- Create secure note: "NeonPanda - Stripe Production Keys"
- Store all secret keys there during migration
- Share with team members securely (via password manager sharing)

#### For Long-Term Storage

- AWS Amplify Console Environment Variables (primary)
- AWS Secrets Manager (optional backup)
- Team password manager (for emergency access)

#### NEVER Store In

- ❌ Git repository (any branch)
- ❌ Slack messages
- ❌ Email
- ❌ Unencrypted files
- ❌ Google Docs/Notion
- ❌ Code comments

### Verify Safe Commits

Before committing any Stripe-related changes:

```bash
# Check for secret keys in staged files
git diff --cached | grep -i "sk_live_"
git diff --cached | grep -i "whsec_"
git diff --cached | grep -i "secret"

# If any matches found, DO NOT COMMIT
```

Add to `.gitignore` if not already present:

```
.env.local
.env.local.prod
.env.*.local
**/*.secret.*
**/secrets/**
```

### Team Access Control

Document who should have access to production Stripe:

- [ ] Owner: [Name] (full access)
- [ ] Tech Lead: [Name] (full access)
- [ ] Finance: [Name] (reporting only)
- [ ] Support: [Name] (customer portal only)

Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Team to manage access levels.

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
ELECTRICPANDA_PRICE_ID=price_xxxxx
EARLYPANDA_PRICE_ID=price_xxxxx
```

#### Frontend (Vite Build)

Set in AWS Amplify Console (prefixed with VITE\_):

```bash
VITE_ELECTRIC_PANDA_PAYMENT_LINK=https://buy.stripe.com/xxxxx
```

#### Where They're Used

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Stripe API authentication (webhooks, portal sessions)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Webhook signature verification
- `ELECTRICPANDA_PRICE_ID`: Map Stripe price → "electric" tier
- `EARLYPANDA_PRICE_ID`: Map Stripe price → "free" tier
- `VITE_ELECTRIC_PANDA_PAYMENT_LINK`: Frontend payment link redirect

### Current Test Configuration

For reference, your test mode configuration should follow this pattern (actual values stored in NOTES_MLF.md):

```
Test Publishable: pk_test_xxxxx (safe to commit)
Test Secret: sk_test_xxxxx (NEVER commit - store in NOTES_MLF.md only)
Test Webhook Secret: whsec_xxxxx (NEVER commit - store in NOTES_MLF.md only)
Test EarlyPanda Price: price_xxxxx
Test ElectricPanda Price: price_xxxxx
Test Payment Link: https://buy.stripe.com/test_xxxxx
```

### Price Validation

After creating production products, verify the price mapping logic in:
`amplify/functions/libs/subscription/stripe-helpers.ts`

The `mapStripePriceToTier()` function should correctly map:

- Production ElectricPanda price → "electric" tier
- Production EarlyPanda price → "free" tier
