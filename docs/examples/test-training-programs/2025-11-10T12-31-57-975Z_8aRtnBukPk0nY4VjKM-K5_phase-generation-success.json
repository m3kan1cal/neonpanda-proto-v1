Victoria's response demonstrates periodization thinking by requesting the exact race date to reverse-engineer training blocks, showing respect for proper aerobic base development before race-specific work. The user's hip mobility issues persist but are managed, requiring ongoing attention in programming.\\n\\nGoals: Complete three half marathons in February, March, and April 2026, Maintain and progress strength in squats, deadlifts, push presses, and clean complexes while running, Achieve first toe-to-bar rep (closest breakthrough), Develop wall walk and muscle-up capacity from zero reps, Stay CrossFit-ready despite endurance training focus, Integrate extensive non-traditional exercise variety into programming\\nRecent Progress: Bench press remains strongest lift, Toe-to-bar skill development progressing toward first rep, Consistent 5-6 day per week training adherence maintained, Hip mobility issues managed without training disruption, Strong foundation in hybrid strength and conditioning approach established\\nCommunication Style: Responds well to strategic questioning and detailed planning; appreciates comprehensive exercise options and variety; values clear rationale for programming decisions\\nTraining Preferences: Hybrid strength and conditioning approach for variety and engagement, 5-6 training days per week in 75-minute sessions, Extensive exercise variety across movement categories, Non-traditional exercises integrated with CrossFit staples, Maintains CrossFit readiness even when not competing, Mobility work integration for hip issues\\nMethodology Preferences: Masters CrossFit training, Hybrid strength and conditioning model, Periodization-based programming, Aerobic base building, Race-specific endurance training, Block periodization for endurance events | Preferred Approaches: Reverse-engineering training blocks from competition dates, Progressive aerobic base development before race-specific work, Intelligent volume management between strength and endurance, Exercise variety and rotation within movement categories, Skill progression work integrated into main programming, Mobility-focused warm-ups and accessory work | Questions: How to structure training blocks for multiple half marathons while maintaining strength, Optimal timing for shifting from strength emphasis to running volume, Integration strategy for 50+ exercise variations into coherent programming\\nEmotional State: Enthusiastic and engaged with new challenge; confident in communicating detailed preferences and equipment capabilities (motivation: High - proactively planning complex multi-goal program months in advance; excited about balancing competing demands of endurance and strength)\\nKey Insights: User has extensive home gym equipment including full Hammer Strength machine lineup, suggesting serious training investment and capability, Listed 50+ specific exercises across 7 categories, indicating desire for significant variety and rotation in programming, Bench press strength maintained as priority even while focusing on lower body movements for running, User recognizes need to 'shift a little bit for running' but wants to maintain hybrid approach, showing realistic understanding of training trade-offs, Three half marathons in consecutive months suggests ambitious endurance goal requiring careful periodization, T2B described as 'pretty close' to first rep suggests imminent breakthrough with proper skill work integration, User frames hip issues as 'mobility' rather than injury, indicating proactive management approach\\nImportant Context: Masters athlete with decades of lifting experience, Owns comprehensive garage gym with Hammer Strength machines, full CrossFit equipment, and specialty implements, No current CrossFit competitions scheduled but maintains 'always ready' mentality, Hip pinching and mobility limitations require ongoing attention in programming, Currently cannot perform single rep of T2B, wall walks, or muscle-ups but progressing on T2B, Training timeline: 12-16 weeks until first half marathon (exact date needed for periodization), Prefers hybrid training approach for engagement and variety over pure specialization\\n\\nConsider injuries, preferences, and past experiences when prescribing exercises.\\n\\nCRITICAL JSON FORMATTING RULES:\\n- Return ONLY valid JSON.
