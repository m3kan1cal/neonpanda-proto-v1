     "content": "Great! Got this logged for you. Let me break down what you crushed here:\n\n**Fortis Interval - November 18, 2025**\n- 10 rounds × 10 hang power cleans @ 115# = **100 total reps**\n- 30-second work intervals with 90-second rest windows\n- Session duration: 30 minutes (10 rounds × 2-minute cycle)\n- RPE/intensity: Appears to be solid technical work at a manageable pace\n\nThis is excellent interval structure for hang power clean technique maintenance and power output. The 3:1 work-to-rest ratio gave you plenty of recovery between intervals, which is smart programming for heavy barbell cycling—you weren't chasing fatigue, you were chasing quality reps and consistent power production.\n\n**A few coaching observations:**\n\nSince you completed this 3 days ago (Tuesday), you've already hit two solid sessions this week—the strength endurance work on Fortis Endura and the power output on Fortis Cursus today. This interval session sits nicely in between, focused on barbell cycling efficiency at a moderate load (85% of your typical power clean working weight based on your recent training).\n\n**Quick question to calibrate your experience:** How did the power output feel across all 10 rounds? Were you maintaining consistent speed on the bar, or did you notice a drop-off in the later rounds? That'll help me understand your current fatigue tolerance and pacing strategy with hang power cleans.",

The fact that you finished in the wall balls of round 8 tells me your pacing was solid; you weren't blowing up early.\n\n**One thing to note:** You completed this *same morning* as the interval hang power clean session later that day (both 11/18). That's a fairly demanding day—metabolic conditioning in the morning, then heavy barbell cycling in the afternoon. How did you feel moving into that second session? Recovery between them adequate, or did you notice carryover fatigue?\n\nThis gives me good context for how you're managing multiple stimulus types in a single training day, which matters for your periodization and competition prep strategy.",

The fact that you felt 7/10 difficulty on the squats while maintaining form across all three sets tells me the weight is in a good working range for volume tolerance.\n\n**What stands out to me:**\n\nYour HRV at 65ms is solid recovery status—you're well-positioned for this intensity level. The 4 rounds even on the AMRAP is consistent pacing, which suggests you weren't chasing it too hard early. That's smart race strategy for a 12-minute window.\n\n**One coaching note:** You've now completed two significant sessions in the past 48 hours (the 11/18 double-session day + this 11/19 strength-focused work). Your recovery metrics look good, but I want to make sure we're structuring your next 2-3 days intelligently to capitalize on this training block without overreaching.\n\nWhat does your schedule look like for the next few days?

That's a solid EMOM structure - heavy bench press paired with gymnastics work is perfect for building that competition-ready strength and conditioning.\n\nI've got the core details locked in. One quick question that really helps me coach you better:\n\n**What was your RPE on this one (1-10)?** This tells me if you're recovering properly between sessions and helps me spot if you're pushing too hard or need more intensity.
