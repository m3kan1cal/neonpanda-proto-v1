Your coach is going to LOVE working with this because there's real room for improvement here while we keep you training hard. We'll program around those limitations smart while also chipping away at them. 🎯\n\nNow, here's a big one for dialing in your coach's personality: **What kind of motivation style fires you up?** Are you the type who needs someone in your corner being supportive and encouraging, or do you respond better to a coach who's more direct and pushes you hard with tough love?

Your coach is shaping up to be exactly that kind of no-nonsense accountability partner. 💯\n\nAlright, let's talk about how you actually want to track your progress: **What metrics matter most to you for measuring success?** Are you tracking specific lifts (like hitting certain numbers on your squat or deadlift)?

Real life stuff. 💪\n\nLet's talk equipment since you mentioned both spots: **Walk me through what you've got access to between your garage gym and the powerlifting gym.** Barbell and plates obviously, but what else?

Or is this more of a \"steady long-term progress, no rush\" kind of vibe? (This helps your coach balance intensity and recovery to get you there without burning out)",

That's a tight but totally doable timeline for hitting new PRs, especially since you're already training consistently. Your coach can structure a focused strength block to peak you right around then. 🎯\n\nHere's an important one for programming: **Are there any movements or exercises you just really don't enjoy or want to avoid?** Maybe you hate Bulgarian split squats, can't stand burpees, or just really don't vibe with certain exercises? (Your coach can work around stuff you dislike - no point grinding through movements that make training feel like a chore when there are plenty of effective alternatives)",

That's gold for your coach - they can lean into your strengths while strategically building up those weaknesses. The fact that you *want* to tackle the hard stuff instead of avoiding it? That's the attitude that gets PRs. 💪\n\nQuick one for context: **How old are you?** (Just helps your coach dial in recovery needs and training intensity appropriately - a 25-year-old and a 45-year-old can both crush PRs, but the programming tweaks are different)",

At 52, you've got the advantage of training smarter (you know your body way better than you did at 25), and your coach will make sure recovery and intensity are balanced perfectly to keep you hitting those PRs without beating yourself up.\n\nLast key piece before we create your coach: **What kind of coaching style fires you up?** Are you someone who needs tough love and direct accountability (\"let's go, stop making excuses\"), or do you prefer a more encouraging, supportive approach (\"you've got this, let's break it down together\")?
