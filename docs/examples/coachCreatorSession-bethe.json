This will take about 15-20 minutes, and I'll adapt the questions based on your experience level.\n\nBefore we dive in, do you have a gender preference for your coach? Some people connect better with a male or female coaching style. You can say 'male', 'female', or 'no preference' - totally up to you!",

But help me dial this in - when you picture yourself crushing a workout with T-Swift in your ears, what does that look like? Are we talking quick daily sessions to feel good, building strength and muscle, training for something specific, or just showing up consistently and seeing what happens?\n\nWhat's the vibe you're after?",

We're building one that actually gives you energy back and fits into the chaos.\n\nQuick question: when you say you hate exercise, is that all movement, or more like \"I hate the gym grind and feeling wiped after\"? Because there's a huge difference between moving your body in ways that feel good versus punishing yourself with workouts you dread.\n\nAnd those rare moments when you DO have time â€“ are we talking 15 minutes at home, or could you carve out 30-45 if it actually helped you handle stress better?",
