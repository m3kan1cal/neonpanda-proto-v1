Now, I would like to create a new email that will go out to beta users on the updates that have happened this week. I want the style and theme to be based on the @beta-update-oct-15-2025.html email, use the exact same format, fonts, styles, colors, and tone. Make the update this time based on the updates that we've applied in the latest @changelogData.js version. Call out specifically the mobile UI update and the analytics updates. Use the @BRANDING_STRATEGY.md document for the tone and make sure the release adheres and matches the tone in that document. Do you understand?
