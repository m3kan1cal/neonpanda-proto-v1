## Brand Story & Vision

### The Problem We Solve
**The Current Reality**: Athletes choose between expensive human coaches ($100-300/month) or generic fitness apps that treat everyone the same. Most apps give you workouts, but they don't understand *you* - your goals, your weaknesses, your psychology, or your methodology preferences.

**The CoachForge Solution**: We let you **forge your perfect AI coach** - one that understands your specific goals, movement patterns, training philosophy, and personality. Not a generic chatbot, but a precision-engineered coaching intelligence built specifically for you.

### Our North Star Vision
*"Every athlete deserves a coach who understands their unique potential, methodology preferences, and movement patterns - available 24/7, evolving with their progress, and backed by the science of human performance."*
