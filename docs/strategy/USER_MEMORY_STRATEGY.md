# NeonPanda Memory Strategy - Your Coach That Actually Remembers

## Overview

The NeonPanda Memory feature lets your AI coach remember what matters to you across all your conversations. Just tell your coach "remember that I..." and they'll keep that in mind for every future session. It's like having a coach who never forgets your preferences, goals, or those little details that make coaching feel personal.

## Architecture Philosophy - Memory That Just Works

### Core Principles
- **You're In Control**: Just say "remember that I..." and your coach handles the rest
- **Smart Detection**: AI automatically detects when you want something remembered
- **Invisible Integration**: Memories seamlessly become part of every conversation
- **Never Interrupts**: Memory operations happen in the background - no conversation disruption
- **Your Privacy**: You control what's remembered and can see everything stored

### Design Goals
1. **Natural as Breathing**: Just talk naturally - "remember that I prefer morning workouts"
2. **No False Alarms**: Conservative detection so we only remember what you actually want remembered
3. **Smart Organization**: Memories organized by type and importance for maximum coaching value
4. **Lightning Fast**: Background operations never slow down your conversations
5. **Built to Scale**: Architecture grows with you and the entire Panda Pack

## Implementation Architecture

### Components Overview

```
You Say Something → Smart Detection → Storage → Retrieval → Coach Integration → Better Coaching
       ↓                    ↓            ↓         ↓              ↓                ↓
Natural Language → Bedrock API → DynamoDB → Query Memory → System Prompt → Personal Response
```

### 1. Detection Component - The Smart Listener
**File**: `amplify/functions/libs/coach-conversation/detection.ts`
**Function**: `detectUserMemoryRequest()`

- **Model**: Amazon Bedrock Nova Micro (cost-optimized for classification tasks)
- **Input**: Your message + conversation context (last 3 messages)
- **Output**: Confidence score + extracted memory content with metadata
- **Threshold**: 70% confidence minimum for memory creation (no false alarms!)
- **Processing Time**: ~200-500ms per detection (lightning fast)

**Memory Request Indicators** (the phrases that trigger your coach's memory):
- "I want you to remember..."
- "Please remember that..."
- "Don't forget that I..."
- "Keep in mind that..."
- "For future reference..."

### 2. Storage Component - Your Personal Memory Bank
**File**: `amplify/dynamodb/operations.ts`
**Functions**: `saveUserMemory()`, `queryUserMemories()`, `updateUserMemory()`

**Storage Pattern** (how we organize your memories):
- **Primary Key**: `user#${userId}`
- **Sort Key**: `userMemory#${memoryId}`
- **Entity Type**: `userMemory`

**Memory Types** (how we categorize what you tell us):
- **preference**: Your training preferences, communication style
- **goal**: Your fitness goals, targets, aspirations
- **constraint**: Your physical limitations, time constraints, equipment
- **instruction**: Specific coaching instructions or approaches you prefer
- **context**: Your personal context, background, lifestyle factors

### 3. Integration Component - Making Memories Matter
**File**: `amplify/functions/libs/coach-conversation/prompt-generation.ts`
**Function**: `generateUserMemoriesSection()`

**Prompt Placement**: Section 5.5 (between detailed user background and user context)
**Organization**: Your memories grouped by type with usage statistics
**AI Instructions**: Clear guidance on how your coach should use memories naturally

### 4. Usage Tracking - Smart Memory Management
- **Statistics**: Usage count, last used date, creation date
- **Background Updates**: Non-blocking usage tracking during your conversations
- **Prioritization**: High importance + frequently used memories surface first

## Data Schema

### UserMemory Record Structure
```typescript
interface UserMemory {
  memoryId: string;           // Unique identifier
  userId: string;             // User who owns the memory
  coachId?: string;           // Optional: coach-specific memories
  content: string;            // What to remember
  memoryType: 'preference' | 'goal' | 'constraint' | 'instruction' | 'context';
  metadata: {
    createdAt: Date;          // When memory was created
    lastUsed?: Date;          // Last time used in conversation
    usageCount: number;       // How often referenced
    source: 'explicit_request'; // How memory was created
    importance: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'; // AI-determined importance
    tags?: string[];          // Optional categorization tags
  };
}
```

### DynamoDB Storage Pattern
```json
{
  "pk": "user#user123",
  "sk": "userMemory#user_memory_1703123456789_abc123def",
  "entityType": "userMemory",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "attributes": {
    "memoryId": "user_memory_1703123456789_abc123def",
    "userId": "user123",
    "coachId": "coach456",
    "content": "I prefer morning workouts and like compound movements",
    "memoryType": "preference",
    "metadata": {
      "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "usageCount": 3,
      "source": "explicit_request",
      "importance": "high",
      "tags": ["scheduling", "exercise_preference"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Conversation Flow Integration - How It All Works Together

### Memory Detection Flow
1. **You send message** to your AI coach
2. **Your existing memories retrieved** for conversation context (limit: 10 most relevant)
3. **AI generates response** using your existing memories in prompt
4. **Memory detection runs** on your message (post-response)
5. **If memory detected** (>70% confidence): save memory + add confirmation
6. **Response delivered** to you with optional memory confirmation

### Prompt Integration Example
```
# ATHLETE MEMORIES
Based on previous conversations, here are important things this athlete has specifically asked you to remember:

## Preference Memories
### 1. I prefer morning workouts and like compound movements
- **Importance**: high
- **Usage**: Used 3 times (last: Jan 12, 2025)
- **Created**: Jan 10, 2025

## Goal Memories
### 1. I want to deadlift 400lbs by summer
- **Importance**: high
- **Usage**: Used 5 times (last: Jan 14, 2025)
- **Created**: Jan 8, 2025

**IMPORTANT**: Use these memories to personalize your coaching. When relevant memories apply to the current conversation, reference them naturally to show continuity and personalized care.
```

## Your Experience Design - Memory That Feels Natural

### Natural Language Interface
You interact with memories through natural conversation:

**You**: "Remember that I have a bad lower back and should avoid heavy deadlifts"
**Your Coach**: "✅ I've remembered that for you: 'has a bad lower back and should avoid heavy deadlifts'"

**Next Conversation**:
**You**: "What's a good leg workout for today?"
**Your Coach**: "Given your lower back considerations that we've discussed, I'd recommend focusing on..."

### Memory Feedback
- **Immediate Confirmation**: "✅ I've remembered that for you: [content]"
- **Natural Integration**: Your coach references memories contextually in responses
- **No Explicit Listing**: Memories work behind the scenes unless you directly ask

### Your Privacy Controls
- **Explicit Opt-in**: Only saves memories when you explicitly request it
- **Your Ownership**: All memories belong to you
- **Coach Scoping**: Memories can be coach-specific or global across coaches
- **Content Control**: You control exactly what content is stored

## Quality Assurance

### Detection Accuracy
- **Conservative Threshold**: 70% confidence prevents false positives
- **Context Awareness**: Uses last 3 messages for better understanding
- **Type Classification**: AI determines appropriate memory type and importance
- **Validation**: Content extraction validated before storage

### Memory Management
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Similar memories for same athlete/coach filtered
- **Quality Control**: Minimum content length and relevance checks
