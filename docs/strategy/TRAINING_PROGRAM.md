**PRIORITIZE THE FOLLOWING:**
- Add hinge frequency, daily T2B skill work
- Power clean momentum is excellent - continue building confidence at 175lbs
- Focus on Deadlift, Back Squat, Bench Press, Push Press for primary strength movements

**WEEKLY MOVEMENT PRIORITIES:**
- Almost daily T2B practice (building toward that breakthrough)
- T2B skill work needs consistent daily integration
- Power clean rotation (you loved the 175# progression)
- Horizontal & vertical pulling emphasis
- Weakness integration (burpee box jump-overs, push press, gymnastics, thrusters, angled wall walk holds)
- Hinge movement frequency too low
