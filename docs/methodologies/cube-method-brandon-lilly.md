# Cube Method (Brandon Lilly)

## Overview

The Cube Method is a powerlifting training system developed by Brandon Lilly that combines elements of various successful training methodologies into a cohesive program. The system is built around a 3-week wave structure where each week focuses on a different training quality: explosive/speed work, heavy singles, and volume/repetition work. This approach allows for the development of multiple strength qualities while maintaining focus on the powerlifting competition lifts.

The methodology emphasizes the importance of training different aspects of strength in a rotating fashion, preventing staleness and accommodation while ensuring comprehensive development. The Cube Method incorporates elements from Westside Barbell, 5/3/1, and other proven systems, creating a hybrid approach that aims to capture the benefits of each while minimizing their individual limitations. The program is designed to be flexible and adaptable to individual needs while maintaining its core structure.

## Creator/Origin

Brandon Lilly developed the Cube Method based on his experience as an elite powerlifter and his study of various training methodologies. Lilly, who achieved elite totals in multiple weight classes and competed at the highest levels of powerlifting, created this system after experimenting with different training approaches throughout his career. His background includes training with various methodologies including Westside Barbell, Metal Militia, and other systems.

The Cube Method was first introduced in Lilly's book "The Cube Method" and gained popularity through his seminars and online presence. Lilly developed the system to address what he saw as limitations in existing programs, creating a methodology that could be adapted to different experience levels and goals while maintaining effectiveness for competitive powerlifting. The system reflects his practical experience and understanding of what works for strength development.

## Key Principles

**Wave Periodization**: Using 3-week waves that cycle through different training emphases to develop multiple strength qualities.

**Explosive/Speed Work**: Developing rate of force development and explosive strength through dynamic effort training.

**Heavy Singles**: Building maximal strength and neural efficiency through heavy single repetitions.

**Volume/Repetition Work**: Developing work capacity, muscle mass, and strength endurance through higher repetition training.

**Accommodation Prevention**: Rotating training emphasis to prevent staleness and maintain progress.

**Flexibility**: Allowing for individual modifications while maintaining the core structure.

**Competition Preparation**: Designing the program to peak for powerlifting competitions.

**Progressive Overload**: Systematically increasing training loads and intensities over time.

## Programming Structure

**3-Week Wave Structure**:

- Week 1: Explosive/Speed Work
- Week 2: Heavy Singles
- Week 3: Volume/Repetition Work

**Weekly Training Split**:

- Day 1: Squat Focus
- Day 2: Bench Press Focus
- Day 3: Deadlift Focus
- Optional Day 4: Accessory/Weakness Work

**Wave Characteristics**:

- **Explosive Week**: 8-10 sets of 3 reps at 50-60% with bands/chains or speed focus
- **Heavy Week**: Work up to heavy singles at 90-105% of current max
- **Volume Week**: 3-5 sets of 5-8 reps at 70-85% intensity

**Accessory Work**: 2-4 exercises per session targeting weaknesses and supporting the main lifts.

**Cycle Progression**: After completing a 3-week wave, increase training maxes and begin the next cycle.

## Target Audience

**Intermediate to Advanced Powerlifters**: Lifters with solid technique who need more sophisticated programming than linear progression.

**Competitive Athletes**: Those preparing for powerlifting competitions who need systematic peaking strategies.

**Strength Enthusiasts**: Individuals focused on maximizing their squat, bench press, and deadlift performance.

**Coaches**: Trainers working with powerlifters who need a structured yet flexible programming approach.

**Plateau Breakers**: Lifters who have stalled on other programs and need a different training stimulus.

**Hybrid Trainees**: Those who want to combine elements from different successful methodologies.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

**Pros**:

- Combines proven elements from multiple systems
- Prevents accommodation through rotating emphases
- Flexible and adaptable to individual needs

- May not provide enough specialization for some goals
- Requires accurate max estimation
- Can be difficult to autoregulate
- May not suit all recovery capacities
- Success depends on proper implementation

## Implementation Guidelines

**Step 1: Assess Experience Level**: Ensure you have intermediate or advanced training experience and solid technique.

**Step 2: Establish Training Maxes**: Accurately determine your current 1RM or training max for all three lifts.

**Step 3: Plan Equipment Needs**: Ensure access to bands, chains, or other equipment for explosive work.

**Step 4: Set Up Training Schedule**: Organize your week around the 3-4 training days with adequate recovery.

**Step 5: Execute First Wave**: Complete the 3-week cycle following the prescribed structure exactly.

**Step 6: Assess and Adjust**: Evaluate your response to the first wave and make necessary modifications.

**Step 7: Progress Training Maxes**: Increase your training maxes appropriately before beginning the next wave.

**Step 8: Continue Cycling**: Repeat the wave structure while monitoring progress and making adjustments.

## Variations and Specializations

**Cube Method for Raw Lifters**: Modifications for powerlifters competing without supportive equipment.

**Cube Method for Equipped Lifters**: Adaptations for those using powerlifting gear and equipment.

**Cube Predator**: An advanced version with additional complexity and specialization options.

## Scientific Basis

The Cube Method incorporates several evidence-based training principles:

**Conjugate Training**: Research supports training multiple qualities simultaneously for optimal strength development.

**Periodization**: The wave structure follows established periodization principles for managing training stress.

**Rate of Force Development**: Speed work targets improvements in explosive strength and power production.

**Neural Adaptations**: Heavy singles promote neural efficiency and maximal strength development.

**Hypertrophy**: Volume work supports muscle growth and strength endurance development.

**Variation**: Regular changes in training stimulus prevent accommodation and maintain progress.

**Specificity**: Focus on competition lifts follows the principle of specific adaptation to imposed demands.

## Common Mistakes and Solutions

**Inappropriate Experience Level**: Attempting the program without sufficient training background or technique proficiency.

**Poor Max Estimation**: Using incorrect training maxes leading to inappropriate training loads.

**Skipping Phases**: Not completing full waves or skipping certain training emphases.

**Inadequate Recovery**: Not providing sufficient rest between training sessions or waves.

**Overcomplicating**: Adding unnecessary complexity or modifications without understanding the system.

**Equipment Limitations**: Attempting explosive work without proper equipment or setup.

**Ignoring Accessory Work**: Neglecting the assistance exercises that support the main lifts.

**Inconsistent Execution**: Not following the prescribed structure or frequently changing the program.

## Integration Applications

**With Competition Preparation**: Designed specifically for powerlifting competition preparation and peaking.

**With Other Methodologies**: Can be alternated with other systems or incorporated into larger periodized plans.

**With Sport Training**: Adaptable for team sport athletes requiring strength development.

**With Recovery Protocols**: Integrates well with various recovery methods and modalities.

**With Nutrition**: Can be combined with specific nutrition strategies for strength and body composition goals.

**With Technique Work**: Allows for technical development through varied training stimuli.

**With Specialization**: Can be modified to emphasize specific lifts or address individual weaknesses.

**Periodization Integration**: Serves as a complete training system or can be used as specific mesocycles within larger plans.
