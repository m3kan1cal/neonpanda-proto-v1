# Stress Management

## Overview

Stress Management is a comprehensive methodology focused on identifying, understanding, and effectively managing the various stressors that impact athletic performance, recovery, and overall well-being. This approach emphasizes the development of coping strategies, stress reduction techniques, and resilience building to optimize both performance and life quality while maintaining sustainable training and lifestyle practices.

## Creator/Origin

Stress Management as a systematic methodology for athletes emerged from the work of sports psychologists, stress researchers, and performance specialists. Key contributors include Hans Selye (General Adaptation Syndrome), Herbert Benson (Relaxation Response), and contemporary sports psychologists who have applied stress research to athletic performance.

The philosophy recognizes stress as a manageable factor that can be optimized for performance and well-being. Rather than eliminating all stress, the approach focuses on developing resilience and coping strategies to thrive under pressure while avoiding chronic overload.
