# Recovery Protocols

## Overview

Recovery Protocols represent a systematic methodology for optimizing the restoration and regeneration processes that occur between training sessions. This approach emphasizes the strategic use of various recovery modalities, lifestyle interventions, and monitoring techniques to enhance adaptation, prevent overtraining, and maintain peak performance capacity.

## Creator/Origin
