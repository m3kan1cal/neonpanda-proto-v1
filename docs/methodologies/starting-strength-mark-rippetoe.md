# Starting Strength (Mark Rippetoe)

## Overview

Starting Strength is a linear progression strength training program designed specifically for novice lifters who are new to barbell training. Created by Mark Rippetoe, this methodology focuses on teaching and developing proficiency in five fundamental barbell movements: squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, and power clean. The program emphasizes proper technique, consistent progression, and the development of basic strength through compound movements.

The core philosophy centers on the principle that novice lifters can recover from and adapt to training stress within 48-72 hours, allowing for frequent training and rapid strength gains. The program uses a simple linear progression model where weight is added to the bar every training session, making it ideal for beginners who can still make session-to-session progress. Starting Strength prioritizes building a solid foundation of strength and movement competency before advancing to more complex programming.

## Creator/Origin

Mark Rippetoe developed Starting Strength based on his extensive experience as a strength coach, competitive powerlifter, and gym owner. Rippetoe, who holds a bachelor's degree in geology and a master's degree in exercise physiology, began coaching in the 1980s and developed his methodology through decades of working with novice lifters at his gym in Wichita Falls, Texas.

The program was first published in Rippetoe's book "Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training" in 2005, which became one of the most influential strength training books for beginners. The methodology was refined through years of practical application and feedback from thousands of novice lifters. Rippetoe's approach emphasizes biomechanics, proper form, and progressive overload as the fundamental principles of strength development for beginners.

## Key Principles

**Linear Progression**: Adding weight to the bar every training session, taking advantage of the novice's rapid adaptation capacity.

**Compound Movement Focus**: Emphasizing multi-joint exercises that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously and provide the greatest training effect.

**Proper Technique First**: Prioritizing correct form and movement patterns before pursuing heavy weights.

**Frequency and Consistency**: Training each lift multiple times per week to develop motor patterns and strength simultaneously.

**Progressive Overload**: Systematically increasing training stress through added weight to drive continuous adaptation.

**Simplicity**: Focusing on a small number of highly effective exercises rather than program complexity.

**Recovery Integration**: Balancing training stress with adequate rest, nutrition, and sleep for optimal adaptation.

**Strength as Foundation**: Building basic strength before progressing to more specialized training methods.

## Programming Structure

**Basic Program Structure**:

- 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
- Alternating A and B workouts
- 45-60 minutes per session

**Workout A**:

- Squat: 3 sets of 5 reps
- Bench Press: 3 sets of 5 reps
- Deadlift: 1 set of 5 reps (alternating with power clean)

**Workout B**:

- Squat: 3 sets of 5 reps
- Overhead Press: 3 sets of 5 reps
- Power Clean: 5 sets of 3 reps (or deadlift)

**Progression Protocol**:

- Squat: +5 lbs every session
- Bench Press: +5 lbs every session
- Overhead Press: +5 lbs every session
- Deadlift: +10 lbs every session
- Power Clean: +5 lbs every session

**Advanced Novice Modifications**:

- Reduce squat frequency to every other session

- Implement microloading for upper body lifts

## Target Audience

**Complete Beginners**: Individuals with little to no experience with barbell training who need to learn basic movement patterns.

**Young Athletes**: High school and college athletes building a strength foundation for their sport.

**Detrained Individuals**: People returning to training after extended time away who need to rebuild their base.

**Older Beginners**: Adults starting strength training later in life who can benefit from the systematic approach.

**General Population**: Anyone seeking to build basic strength and muscle mass through proven methods.

**Novice Powerlifters**: Beginning competitive lifters who need to develop proficiency in the competition lifts.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

**Pros**:

## Implementation Guidelines

**Step 1: Learn the Movements**: Study proper technique for all five lifts through the Starting Strength book, videos, or qualified instruction.

**Step 2: Establish Starting Weights**: Begin with empty barbell or light weights that allow perfect form for all prescribed reps.

**Step 3: Set Up Training Schedule**: Commit to training 3 days per week with at least one rest day between sessions.

**Step 4: Focus on Form**: Prioritize proper technique over weight progression, especially in the first few weeks.

**Step 5: Follow Progression**: Add weight every session as prescribed, maintaining proper form throughout.

**Step 6: Track Progress**: Record all lifts, weights, and reps to monitor progression and identify when modifications are needed.

**Step 7: Address Stalls**: When linear progression stops, implement resets, microloading, or transition to intermediate programming.

**Step 8: Prepare for Transition**: Recognize when novice gains are exhausted and prepare to move to intermediate programming.

## Variations and Specializations

**Starting Strength with Power Cleans**: The original program including power cleans for explosive power development.

**Starting Strength without Power Cleans**: Modified version replacing power cleans with additional deadlifts for those unable to learn the clean.

**Starting Strength for Older Lifters**: Adaptations including longer rest periods, slower progression, and additional warm-up requirements.

**Starting Strength for Women**: Modifications addressing typically slower progression rates and different strength distribution patterns.

**Starting Strength Linear Progression**: Extended version with additional exercises and modifications for continued progress.

**Practical Programming Novice**: Rippetoe's more detailed programming approach from his "Practical Programming" book.

**Greyskull LP**: Popular variation incorporating AMRAP sets and upper body focus modifications.

## Scientific Basis

The Starting Strength methodology is grounded in several established exercise science principles:

**Novice Adaptation**: Research supports that untrained individuals can adapt to training stress within 48-72 hours, allowing for frequent training.

**Progressive Overload**: The systematic increase in training load is fundamental to strength development and well-supported by research.

**Compound Movement Efficacy**: Studies demonstrate that multi-joint exercises produce greater strength and muscle gains than isolation exercises.

**Motor Learning**: Frequent practice of movement patterns accelerates skill acquisition and strength development in novices.

**Specificity**: Training the movements you want to improve produces the greatest gains in those specific patterns.

**Recovery and Adaptation**: Research supports the importance of adequate rest and nutrition for training adaptations.

## Common Mistakes and Solutions

**Starting Too Heavy**: Beginning with weights that are too challenging, leading to form breakdown and slower progress.

**Ignoring Form**: Prioritizing weight increases over proper technique, leading to injury risk and inefficient movement patterns.

**Inconsistent Training**: Missing sessions or not following the prescribed frequency, which slows progress significantly.

**Inadequate Recovery**: Not getting enough sleep, nutrition, or rest between sessions to support adaptation.

**Continuing Too Long**: Attempting to milk linear progression beyond its useful lifespan instead of progressing to intermediate programming.

**Adding Unnecessary Exercises**: Complicating the program with additional exercises that interfere with recovery and progress.

**Improper Stall Management**: Not knowing how to handle plateaus or when to reset weights appropriately.

**Neglecting Mobility**: Ignoring flexibility and mobility work that supports proper movement patterns.

## Integration Applications

**With Sport Training**: Can serve as an off-season strength foundation for athletes in various sports.

**With Conditioning**: Can be combined with cardiovascular training, though recovery must be carefully managed.

**Into Intermediate Programming**: Serves as preparation for more complex programs like 5/3/1, Texas Method, or periodized approaches.

**With Powerlifting**: Provides foundation for competitive powerlifting training and technique development.

**With General Fitness**: Can be integrated into broader fitness programs focusing on strength as one component.

**With Bodybuilding**: Can serve as a strength foundation before transitioning to hypertrophy-focused training.

**With Functional Training**: Provides strength base that supports more complex functional movement patterns.

**Periodization Integration**: Serves as the initial phase in long-term athletic development and periodized training plans.

```

**Warm-Up Protocol Template:**

```
Example for 225 lb work weight squat:
- Empty bar (45 lbs): 2x5
- 95 lbs: 1x5
- 135 lbs: 1x3
- 185 lbs: 1x2
- 205 lbs: 1x1
- 225 lbs: 3x5 (work sets)

Jumps should be roughly equal, covering the distance from bar to work weight
```

**Progression Rate Examples:**

- **Squat**: +10 lbs/session initially, dropping to +5 lbs after 2-4 weeks
- **Deadlift**: +10-15 lbs/session initially, dropping to +5-10 lbs
- **Bench Press**: +5 lbs/session, may need 2.5 lb plates after 4-6 weeks
- **Overhead Press**: +5 lbs/session, first to stall, use microloading early
- **Power Clean**: +5 lbs/session, technique-dependent progression

**Reset Protocol:**

```
If you fail to complete 3x5 at a weight for 3 sessions:
1. Reduce the weight by 10%
2. Resume linear progression from new weight
3. Example: Failed at 200 lbs three times
   - Reset to 180 lbs
   - Progress: 180 → 185 → 190 → 195 → 200 → 205...
```

**Stall Management Templates:**

- **First Stall**: Reset 10%, continue linear progression
- **Second Stall**: Reset 10%, switch to 3x5 then 1x5 AMRAP
- **Third Stall**: Consider transitioning to intermediate programming (Texas Method, etc.)
- **Microloading**: Use 1.25 lb plates for 2.5 lb jumps on pressing movements

**Common Modifications:**

- **Without Power Clean**: Replace with barbell rows or additional deadlift work
- **Older Lifters**: Smaller jumps (2.5-5 lbs), longer recovery between sessions
- **Female Lifters**: Start with 5 lb jumps on all lifts, 2.5 lb microloading sooner
- **Underweight Lifters**: Emphasize eating in surplus, may progress faster
- **Athletes**: Reduce conditioning work to preserve recovery for lifting

**Transition to Intermediate Programming:**

- **When**: Linear progression exhausted (typically 3-9 months)
- **Signs**: Multiple resets on multiple lifts, recovery issues despite eating/sleeping
- **Options**: Texas Method, 5/3/1, Heavy-Light-Medium, Starr Model
- **Key Principle**: Move from session-to-session to week-to-week progression
