# High Frequency Training

## Overview
High Frequency Training (HFT) is a training methodology that emphasizes training muscle groups, movement patterns, or skills multiple times per week, often daily. This approach focuses on increased training frequency to enhance motor learning, improve recovery between sessions, and maximize training adaptations through consistent stimulus application.

## Creator/Origin
- **Creator**: Various contributors including Chad Waterbury, Christian Thibaudeau, and Pavel Tsatsouline
- **Origin**: Developed from observations of Eastern European training methods and neural adaptation research
- **Background**: Based on principles of motor learning, neural adaptation, and recovery optimization
- **Philosophy**: Frequent practice leads to superior skill acquisition and strength development

## Key Principles

### 1. Frequent Stimulation
- Training movements or muscle groups multiple times per week
- Daily practice of key movement patterns
- Consistent neural activation and motor learning
- Avoiding prolonged gaps between training sessions

### 2. Submaximal Intensity
- Training at 70-85% of maximum capacity
- Avoiding failure and excessive fatigue
- Maintaining movement quality and technique
- Sustainable intensity for frequent sessions

### 3. Motor Learning Enhancement
- Frequent practice improves skill acquisition
- Neural adaptations through repetition
- Movement pattern refinement
- Technique improvement through volume

### 4. Recovery Optimization
- Shorter, more frequent sessions
- Reduced overall session fatigue
- Enhanced recovery between workouts
- Improved adaptation through consistent stimulus

### 5. Autoregulation
- Adjusting training based on daily readiness
- Listening to body feedback
- Modifying intensity and volume as needed
- Sustainable long-term approach

## Programming Structure

### Daily Structure
- **Warm-up**: Movement preparation (10-15 minutes)
- **Main Training**: Focused skill or strength work (20-30 minutes)
- **Cool-down**: Recovery and mobility (10-15 minutes)
- **Total Session**: 40-60 minutes maximum

### Weekly Programming
- **Monday**: Primary movement focus with moderate intensity
- **Tuesday**: Secondary movement with skill emphasis
- **Wednesday**: Primary movement with varied intensity
- **Thursday**: Recovery and mobility focus
- **Friday**: Primary movement with testing
- **Saturday**: Secondary movement and conditioning
- **Sunday**: Active recovery or complete rest

### Monthly Cycles
- **Week 1-2**: Volume accumulation and skill development
- **Week 3**: Intensity increase with maintained frequency
- **Week 4**: Deload with reduced volume, maintained frequency

### Seasonal Periodization
- **Base Phase**: Movement quality and frequency establishment
- **Build Phase**: Progressive loading with maintained frequency
- **Peak Phase**: Testing and maximum effort displays
- **Recovery Phase**: Reduced intensity, maintained frequency
