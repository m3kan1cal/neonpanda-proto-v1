# High Frequency Training

## Overview

High Frequency Training (HFT) is a training methodology that emphasizes training muscle groups, movement patterns, or skills multiple times per week, often daily. This approach focuses on increased training frequency to enhance motor learning, improve recovery between sessions, and maximize training adaptations through consistent stimulus application.

## Creator/Origin

High Frequency Training emerged from observations of Eastern European training methods and research on neural adaptation by various coaches and researchers. Key contributors include Chad Waterbury, Christian Thibaudeau, and Pavel Tsatsouline, each bringing unique perspectives to the methodology.

The approach developed from principles of motor learning, neural adaptation, and recovery optimization. The philosophy centers on the idea that frequent practice leads to superior skill acquisition and strength development, challenging traditional bodybuilding-style training splits that train each muscle group only once per week.

## Key Principles

### 1. Frequent Stimulation

- Training movements or muscle groups multiple times per week
- Daily practice of key movement patterns
- Consistent neural activation and motor learning
- Avoiding prolonged gaps between training sessions

### 2. Submaximal Intensity

- Training at 70-85% of maximum capacity
- Avoiding failure and excessive fatigue
- Maintaining movement quality and technique
- Sustainable intensity for frequent sessions

### 3. Motor Learning Enhancement

- Frequent practice improves skill acquisition
- Neural adaptations through repetition
- Movement pattern refinement
- Technique improvement through volume

### 4. Recovery Optimization

- Shorter, more frequent sessions
- Reduced overall session fatigue
- Enhanced recovery between workouts
- Improved adaptation through consistent stimulus

### 5. Autoregulation

- Adjusting training based on daily readiness
- Listening to body feedback
- Modifying intensity and volume as needed
- Sustainable long-term approach

## Programming Structure

## WORKOUT TEMPLATES

**Programming Structure & Ratios:**

- **Frequency**: 5-7 days per week training same movements
- **Volume Per Session**: Low (spread across sessions)
- **Intensity**: Submaximal (70-85% typical)

**6-Day Squat HFT Template:**

```
Monday (Heavy): Work to daily max, 2 back-offs
Tuesday (Light): 4 x 3 @ 70%
Wednesday (Medium): 5 x 3 @ 80%
Thursday (Light): 3 x 5 @ 65%
Friday (Heavy): Work to daily max
Saturday (Medium): 4 x 4 @ 77%
Sunday: Rest
```

**Key HFT Principles:**

- Never train to failure
- Always leave reps in reserve
- Stop when bar speed slows
- Quality over quantity

## Conclusion
