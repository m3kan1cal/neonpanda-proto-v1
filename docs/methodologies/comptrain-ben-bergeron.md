# CompTrain (Ben Bergeron)

## Overview

CompTrain is a comprehensive training methodology developed by Ben Bergeron, one of the most successful CrossFit coaches in history. This system emphasizes intelligent programming, mental training, and systematic athlete development through structured periodization, character building, and performance optimization principles that have produced multiple CrossFit Games champions.

## Creator/Origin

CompTrain was developed by Ben Bergeron, one of the most successful coaches in CrossFit history. Bergeron created the methodology through his experience coaching elite CrossFit athletes, including multiple Games champions Katrin Davidsdottir and Mat Fraser. As the owner of CompTrain and CrossFit New England, Bergeron built his system around the philosophy that "training is practice for life," emphasizing character development through physical training.

Bergeron's approach was shaped by his background in competitive sports and coaching, leading him to develop a comprehensive system that addresses not just physical fitness but mental resilience and character development. His methodology has produced some of the most dominant athletes in CrossFit history and has been adopted by thousands of athletes worldwide through the CompTrain programming platform.
