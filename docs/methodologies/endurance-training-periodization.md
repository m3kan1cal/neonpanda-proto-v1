# Endurance Training Periodization

## Overview

Endurance Training Periodization is a systematic methodology for developing aerobic capacity, lactate threshold, and endurance performance through structured training phases. This approach emphasizes the strategic manipulation of training volume, intensity, and recovery to optimize physiological adaptations and peak performance for endurance events ranging from 5K runs to ultra-marathons and triathlons.

## Creator/Origin

Endurance Training Periodization was developed collectively by exercise physiologists, endurance coaches, and sports scientists over decades. The methodology is heavily influenced by Arthur Lydiard's revolutionary training principles from New Zealand, which emphasized aerobic base building as the foundation for all endurance performance.

Modern contributions from researchers like Stephen Seiler (polarized training) and coaches like Joe Friel have refined the approach, integrating contemporary exercise physiology with proven periodization models.

## Key Principles

### 1. Aerobic Base Development

- Aerobic enzyme and mitochondrial adaptations
- Capillary density and oxygen delivery improvements
- Fat oxidation capacity enhancement

### 2. Progressive Intensity Integration

- Systematic addition of higher intensity work
- Lactate threshold and VO2 max development
- Anaerobic capacity and neuromuscular power
- Race-specific intensity preparation

### 3. Periodized Training Structure

- Base, build, peak, and recovery phases
- Volume and intensity manipulation
- Systematic progression and adaptation
- Peak performance timing

### 4. Recovery and Adaptation
