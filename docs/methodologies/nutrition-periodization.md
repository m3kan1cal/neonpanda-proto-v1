# Nutrition Periodization

## Overview

Nutrition Periodization is a systematic methodology that aligns nutritional strategies with training phases, competition schedules, and performance goals to optimize adaptation, recovery, and athletic performance. This approach emphasizes the strategic manipulation of macronutrients, meal timing, and supplementation to support specific training demands and maximize the benefits of each training phase.

## Creator/Origin

Nutrition Periodization emerged from collective research by sports nutritionists, exercise physiologists, and performance specialists. Key contributors include Asker Jeukendrup, Louise Burke, and John Hawley, whose work on carbohydrate periodization and metabolic flexibility shaped modern sports nutrition practice.

The philosophy treats nutrition as a strategic tool for performance optimization rather than a static dietary approach. This represents a shift from fixed macronutrient recommendations to dynamic nutrition strategies that match training demands and performance goals.

- Pre-workout: 1-4g/kg carbs 1-4 hours before
- During: 30-60g/hour if >60 min
- Post: 1-1.2g/kg carbs + 0.3g/kg protein within 30 min

Low-Intensity/Recovery Days:
- Carbs: 3-5g/kg bodyweight
- Protein: Maintain 1.6-2.2g/kg
- Fat: Increase to fill calorie needs

Strength Training Days:
- Protein: 1.6-2.2g/kg distributed across 4-6 meals
- Pre-workout: 20-40g protein 1-2 hours before
- Post-workout: 20-40g protein within 2 hours

## Conclusion

Nutrition Periodization represents a sophisticated approach to sports nutrition that recognizes the dynamic relationship between training demands and nutritional needs. This methodology emphasizes that optimal nutrition is not a one-size-fits-all approach but requires strategic planning, individualization, and systematic adjustment based on training phases and performance goals. Success requires comprehensive understanding of nutrition science, careful planning and preparation, and consistent monitoring and adjustment, but offers the potential for significant improvements in performance, recovery, and overall health outcomes.
