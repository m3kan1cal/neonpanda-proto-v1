# Nutrition Periodization

## Overview
Nutrition Periodization is a systematic methodology that aligns nutritional strategies with training phases, competition schedules, and performance goals to optimize adaptation, recovery, and athletic performance. This approach emphasizes the strategic manipulation of macronutrients, meal timing, and supplementation to support specific training demands and maximize the benefits of each training phase.
