# NC Fit (Jason Khalipa)

## Overview

NC Fit is a comprehensive functional fitness methodology developed by Jason Khalipa, the 2008 CrossFit Games champion and successful entrepreneur. This system emphasizes practical, scalable fitness that translates to real-world performance and everyday life activities. NC Fit combines functional movements, varied training stimuli, and intelligent programming to develop well-rounded fitness that serves both competitive athletes and general population clients.

The methodology is built on Khalipa's "earn your fitness" philosophy, which emphasizes that true fitness comes through consistent effort, progressive challenge, and mental resilience. Unlike programs that promise quick fixes, NC Fit focuses on building sustainable fitness habits that enhance quality of life while developing the capacity for high-level performance when needed. The system integrates strength, conditioning, gymnastics, and sport-specific skills in a framework that prioritizes movement quality, progressive development, and long-term adherence.

## Creator/Origin
